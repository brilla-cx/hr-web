# Hey Rebekah Security Policy

## Supported versions
As you know, our project is still in its newbie phase. We're like a startup, constantly growing and evolving. That means we don't have any old versions gathering dust in the attic. Nope, we're fresh as a daisy, with every new update, patch, and cool feature applied straight to your current version of Hey Rebekah.

## Reporting a vulnerability

But here's the serious bit. We care about your safety and security. So, if you trip over a security glitch, **[please send us an email](mailto:np@heyrebekah.com)** instead of posting it on the public issue tracker. 

This way, we can address the issue without causing unnecessary panic.

Your help in keeping our community safe is really appreciated. Within 2 days, we'll give you a heads-up that we've received your report. And within a week, we'll provide a more detailed response, filling you in on how we plan to tackle the issue you've discovered.

We'll keep the lines of communication open and keep you updated on our progress in squashing the bug and making the announcement. If you don't hear back from us within 48 hours, drop us another line just to make sure we got your original message.

We're all in this together, so please keep your discovery on the down-low until we've had a chance to address it. Thanks for helping us keep Hey Rebekah safe and secure for everyone.
