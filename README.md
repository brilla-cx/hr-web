## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started with the project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Sanity CLI](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/brilla-cx/hr-web
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd hr-web
```

3. Install the dependencies using PNPM:

```
pnpm install
```

### Testing

To run the tests:

```
pnpm test
```

## Linting & Committs üôà
We will be using the following tools to handle semantic versioning, conventional commits, linting, and changelogs:
1. **Commitizen** - for conventional commits
2. **Husky** with **@commitlint/cli** - to lint your commit messages
3. **Standard Version** - to handle semantic versioning

### üéØ Getting Started with Commitizen
Commitizen offers an easy-to-use interface to help you structure your conventional commits. No more writing by hand!

1. Install Commitizen globally:
   ```
   npm install -g commitizen
   ```
2. Initialize your project with a Commitizen adapter:
   ```
   commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
   ```
3. Start using the interface by running:
   ```
   git cz
   ```
4. (Optional) Install the [VS Code Commitizen extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-commitizen) for an even smoother experience.

### üßπ Linting Your Commits with Husky and @commitlint/cli
Linting helps catch mistakes before they throw off your semantic versioning. Set up Husky and @commitlint/cli to lint your messages before a commit is made:

1. Install the necessary packages:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev husky @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}
   ```
2. Initialize Husky's Git hooks:
   ```
   npx husky install
   ```
3. Add the Commitlint hook:
   ```
   npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no --commitlint --edit "$1"'
   ```
4. Create a configuration file:
   ```
   echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']};"
   > commitlint.config.js
   ```
5. Add the following rules to your `commitlint.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
  plugins: [
    {
      rules: {
        "height-task-number": (parsed) => {
          const { header, body, footer } = parsed;
          const regex = /(Close\s|Link\s)?T-\d{1,7}/;
          const isValid =
            regex.test(header) || regex.test(body) || regex.test(footer);

          if (!isValid) {
            return [
              false,
              "Message must include a Height Task number in the format 'T-#######', 'Close T-#######', or 'Link T-#######'",
            ];
          }
          return [true, ""];
        },
      },
    },
  ],
  rules: {
    "header-max-length": [2, "always", 72],
    "type-enum": [
      2,
      "always",
      ["feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "test", "chore", "revert"],
    ],
    "scope-enum": [
      2,
      "always",
      ["app", "server", "client", "database", "docs", "tests", "lint"],
    ],
    "subject-case": [2, "always", "sentence-case"],
    "body-max-line-length": [2, "always", Infinity],
    "body-leading-blank": [2, "always"],
    "height-task-number": [2, "always"],
    "footer-leading-blank": [2, "always"],
  },
};
```

### üöÄ Versioning and Changelogs with Standard Version
Standard Version ties everything together, making versioning and changelogs a breeze:

1. Install the `standard-version` dependency:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev standard-version
   ```
2. Add a script to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "release": "standard-version"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Run the script to bump the version number and generate a changelog:
   ```
   npm run release
   ```
4. (Optional) Preview changes without committing by using the dry-run mode:
   ```
   npm run release -- --dry-run
   ```

That's it! You've now incorporated conventional commits, linting, versioning, and changelogs into your project in a fun and easy way. Enjoy your streamlined workflow! üéâ
