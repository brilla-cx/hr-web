Welcome to [Hey Rebekah](https://heyrebekah.com)! Picture us as your daily shot of espresso ‚Äî sharp, exhilarating, and potentially lifesaving, especially for those Monday mornings.

Our main job? Cracking our knuckles and diving into crafting thought-provoking content that stands out in your daily news avalanche. 

Our tech team's job? Smoothly delivering these pieces to our bustling community of over 338,000 members across various platforms. This way, we stay true to our mission ‚Äî to make knowledge free.

## Embracing TypeScript: The New Neighbor We Can't Ignore üèòÔ∏è

Just like in any community, new members show up and shake things up a bit. In our digital cul-de-sac, TypeScript has been that quirky, precise new neighbor who's not just passing through. With a love for strict rules and meticulous organization, TypeScript has moved into about 55% of our homes in the codebase neighborhood. It's been a rollercoaster, a block party of growth and adaptation. We're not yet the fully-disciplined, TypeScript-dominated community, but we're getting there, and boy, isn't it an adventure!

## Test Coverage: The Big Bash We've Always Promised üé™

Remember that grandiose neighborhood block party we've always promised but never actually threw? That's our current test coverage. Think of it as the vast open space we've earmarked for the party ‚Äî brimming with potential, but for now, glaringly empty. But, as with any big promise, we're set on making it happen. We're looking to transform this barren plot into a bustling carnival of extensively-tested code. Watch this space, because our "Block Party Coming Soon" banner is going up soon!

## Accessibility: Our Neighborhood's Code of Conduct üëÄ

In our little content town, inclusivity and accessibility aren't just polite suggestions, they're part of our community code of conduct. It's our commitment to make sure our digital streets are not only user-friendly, but welcoming to all, no matter their preferred mode of transport. Be it mouse, keyboard, screen reader, or another assistive tech, we're dedicated to consistently improving our town planning to offer an inviting experience to all. It's not perfect, but it's getting better. After all, what's a community if not welcoming to everyone?

## Into the Future: The Town Planning Committee üèóÔ∏è

Here's a big round of applause for Web3Templates. They've been the supportive town council in this urban development journey. But like town folks hankering for a new dog park or a cozy caf√©, we're itching for some fresh scenery. That's why we're sketching out blueprints for a custom component library, architectured with [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), all stylishly landscaped with TailwindCSS.

And because we firmly believe that growth is the name of the game (and we love a good challenge), we're also transiting to a Vercel Turbo repository. The grand occasion? We thought it's about time to extend our community borders by welcoming our iOS and Android apps into the mix. A little more chatter and liveliness, right? Sure, it's going to add some complexity to the mix - but isn't that the spice of communal life? Here's to future renovations, animated town hall meetings, and of course, lots of shared laughter and learning!

## Toast to our Influences üôè

Cultivating a content neighborhood isn't about merely zoning out blocks and delegating tasks. It's about kindling a collective dream for the limitless potential of the digital metropolis.

In this spirit, our neighborhood isn't just a construction - it's a labor of love. Our inspirations are as varied as they are meaningful:

- The principles of architecture have served as our masterplan, illuminating our path through the boundless expanse of the digital cityscape.
- Accessibility has been our town charter, ensuring our roads and alleys are accessible to all, regardless of their mode of transportation.
- The shadcn and RadixUI blueprints have been our architectural playbook, guiding us through the ever-evolving cityscape of frontend development.
- Juno, the neighborhood's favorite furry mascot, has been a loyal companion, offering joyful romps and welcome distractions.
- Our readers, our true community stakeholders, for whom we build and develop our digital township, continuously inspire us to push the city limits and delve deeper.
- And finally, our impeccable taste has been our urban planner, charting a path through infinite possibilities towards a district of novelty and excellence.

To everyone who's taken part in this communal growth, either by contributing code, sharing insights, or just cheering from the sidelines: We raise our construction helmets to you. Thanks for joining us in our wonderment at the boundless landscape of the digital metropolis.
