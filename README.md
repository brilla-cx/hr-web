# Hey Rebekah Composable Content Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

## About Us üìö

Welcome to Hey Rebekah, your daily dose of knowledge delivered with wit and warmth. We're a free newsletter specifically designed for senior professionals who seek to leverage artificial intelligence in their work. Think of us as a twist on Morning Brew, but with a dash of ChatGPT, Claude, Hugging Face, and Stable Diffusion.

## Our Mission

At Hey Rebekah, our objective is simple: to make your life easier. So, with this project, it starts with us. We're streamlining our publishing workflow, allowing us to focus on creating engaging, top-notch content while our technology takes care of distributing our masterpieces across various platforms where over 338,000 community members await.

## Embracing TypeScript: Halfway Up the Mountain üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We've caught the TypeScript bug, and it's taken over about 55% of our codebase. Imagine us as mountaineers, scaling the steep cliffs of static types. We're over the halfway mark, panting a bit, but excited for the view from the top. We're not quite there yet, but the journey has been worth it, and we're committed to going the distance!

## Test Coverage: Our New Year's Resolution üéâ

Ever made a New Year's resolution? You know, the ones you're absolutely, positively sure you're going to keep this time? That's us with test coverage right now. Truth be told, our current test coverage is like a desert - it's vast, it's empty, it's... zero. But we're determined to turn this desert into an oasis of well-tested code. Stay tuned for our transformation!

## Accessibility: A Commitment, Not an Afterthought ‚ôøÔ∏è

Inclusivity and accessibility aren't just buzzwords to us; they're fundamental principles that guide our work. We're continually improving our platform to ensure that it's not just user-friendly, but friendly to all users. Whether you navigate with a mouse, a keyboard, a screen reader, or any other assistive technology, we're committed to making our content accessible to you. Your experience matters to us, and we're devoted to making it a good one.

## Into the Future: Charting New Waters üöÄ

We tip our hats to Web3Templates for getting us started - they've been the wind beneath our wings, the compass in our uncharted journey. But like a band of pirates weary of the same old sea shanties, we're craving some fresh tunes. That's why we're setting sail towards a bespoke component library, built with [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), all spruced up with TailwindCSS. 

And because we're gluttons for punishment (and innovation), we're also moving to a Vercel Turbo repository. Why, you ask? Well, we figured we'd add some spice to our lives by inviting our iOS and Android apps to the party. More the merrier, right? Sure, it's going to make things more complicated - but who doesn't enjoy a good challenge? Here's to future complications, chaos, and of course, tons of fun!

## Acknowledgements üôè
## Ode to our Inspirations üôè

To paraphrase Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry: If you're building a content cloud, don't just gather code snippets and assign tasks. Instead, kindle a longing for the endless possibilities of the digital cosmos. 

In that spirit, we haven't just been building, but dreaming. Our inspirations are as diverse as they are profound:

- The principles of good design have been our North Star, guiding us through the vast expanse of the creative process.
- Accessibility (a11y) has been our compass, reminding us to create a destination that everyone can reach, regardless of how they journey.
- The shadcn and RadixUI libraries have been our trusty vessels, helping us navigate the swirling seas of frontend development.
- Juno, the best dog on Earth, has been our loyal shipmate, providing boundless enthusiasm and the occasional much-needed distraction.
- Our readers, our true north, for whom we brave these digital waters, continually inspire us to push further and delve deeper.
- And finally, our impeccable taste has been our map, charting a course through the vast ocean of possibilities to an island of innovation and excellence. 

To all those who've journeyed with us, either by contributing code, sharing wisdom, or simply being there: We tip our sailor's cap to you. Thanks for joining us in longing for the endless immensity of the digital sea.
