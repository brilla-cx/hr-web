Listen in as we discuss how businesses are succeeding at social media.</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Use Social Media Strategically</h1><h2 id=\"\">The Early Days of Online Marketing</h2><h5 id=\"\">Rebekah:</h5><p>Share with us a little bit more about yourself. How did you become an expert within your field?</p><h5 id=\"\">Denise:</h5><p>I work primarily with small business owners, entrepreneurs, authors, speakers, and solo professionals to help them with their online marketing.I started in 1996, so it was online marketing then. It wasn’t social media and there was no blogging.And in 1997, teleseminars kind of came in like bridged line that you paid $30 an hour to rent to have a teleseminar. So those are the olden days, but just to give some context for those people who think everything is free, it wasn’t always that way.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Biggest Challenge in Social Media Today</h2><h5 id=\"\">Rebekah:</h5><p>Knowing what you know now, how are you transitioning your offline into online and helping  businesses solve their top  social media challenges?</p><h5 id=\"\">Denise:</h5><p>It’s understanding the complexities that come with social media, because while it may seem simple on the surface, it really isn’t. It's changing all of the time.I also realize that it's a big mindset thing. Most people that come to me are experts within their own field. They know they need to get online and get found, but they have the typical “I don’t have time,” “I don’t understand,” and “I don’t want to do this” complaints.Those kind of issues come to me a lot. The most important thing I try to impress is that this is an important way to get the word out about their business. They need to participate in some way, at least a little bit.There's only so much you can give away. They must be involved on some level and I help them learn how to do that.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Make Social Media Manageable</h2><h5 id=\"\">Rebekah:</h5><p>Whether it's a fear of failure or of the unknown, coming up with an excuse such as a lack of time can be debilitating. Many people take themselves out of the social media game making up stories that simply aren't true.How do you help clients make that shift within their own mind and truly embrace social media?</p><h5 id=\"\">Denise:</h5><p>The first place I start around the “I don’t have time to do this,\" Can somebody else do it for me,”  is to remind them that this is not about blogging. It is not about Facebooking and tweeting and all that. It is about marketing their business and helping the people who have the problems that they solve.I also assure them that they don’t need to be on 10 social networks. That they can start in one place and get comfortable and then put the next layer on and the next layer on. Because once you've mastered one, it's easy to move on and continue connecting, sharing, and commenting.Knowing that there are major similarities between the networks makes it so much easier.</p><h2 id=\"\">Tips on Content Curation and Creation</h2><h5 id=\"\">Rebekah:</h5><p>You are out there practicing what you preach within your own business every day.Can you give some suggestions that might make content curation and creation easier for anyone looking to build their presence online?</p><h5 id=\"\">Denise:</h5><p>Because I started in blogging before any of these social networks existed, I always recommend that people start building up content on their own site first.You have to remember, you don’t own or control these social channels, you're renting real estate.So start on your own blog and create an editorial calendar. Now go find your content and topics.For example, look at the top 10 topics that are relevant to your business. Now make those your top 10 topics and then go down and list five sub-topics you can write about under that one topic. You now  have 50 ideas right there.So that usually has people going, “Oh, okay I do have something to write about.\" The truth of the matter is this -  if you're a professional, you have expertise in something.Now determine your comfort level in creating content and determine how often you can commit to a posting strategy.</p><h5 id=\"\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/breakthrough-social-media/id875541617\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Listen to the full interview and subscribe within iTunes!</a> or Watch the Google+ Hangout Below:</h5><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3yGOcBiNd9M?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure>",

Learn how to begin to post with purpose, clarity and passion!</p><h1 id=\"\">10 Steps to a Solid Social Media Strategy</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Know Your Audience</h2><p>Do you know who your potential clients are, what they do, and what motivates and inspires them?Whether your target market is an individual or a business, it's important to understand why they're using social media and want to connect with you. Take the time to get inside their head.First, define who your target market is, and then identify what problems you solve. What solutions can you provide that will ease their pain, make their life easier, or simplify the buying process?</p><h5 id=\"\">Know Your Audience</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">  Be laser beam focused when describing your market</li> \t<li id=\"\">  Always remember that its easier to earn business through targeted marketing</li> \t<li id=\"\">  It's great to get into the heads of your potential buyers, but even better to get into their hearts</li> \t<li id=\"\">  Put yourself in the shoes of your buyer and truly understand their needs</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822262b8b8c4d2b474162_know-social-media-audience_min.jpeg\" alt=\"know-social-media-audience_min\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Create Targeted Content</h2><p>Getting crystal clear about your target market makes content creation much easier.Learn what’s important to your readers, and then share valuable information that speaks directly to their questions and concerns. Ask what they want to see more about, and how you can best serve them.Taking a genuine interest in your readers goes a long way in building the know, like, and trust factor.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Expand Your Reach</h2><p>Successful companies know that re-purposing content across multiple social channels is the secret sauce to expanding reach.Don't assume your customers only hang out on Facebook. Branch out and share your content on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.Enrich your brand through multi-channel campaigns.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Brand Your Business</h2><p>When setting up accounts on different social media networks, ensure your logo, color scheme, fonts and graphics are consistent.You want your personal brand to be easily identifiable, no matter where people connect with you.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822262b8b8c7f8c474160_brand-social-media.jpeg\" alt=\"brand-social-media\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Be Tactical</h2><p>Have you created a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/creating-winning-social-media-strategy/\" id=\"\">social media strategy</a> or is your strategy to simply show up and throw up on social media?Take a strategic approach to posting. Create a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">content calendar</a> that highlights topics, goals and social networks that will support your marketing strategy.Not sure where to begin?</p><h5 id=\"\">Take these steps to begin posting on purpose!</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Define your topics</li> \t<li id=\"\">Break them down into weekly articles</li> \t<li id=\"\">Choose your social outlets</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  6. Engage, Inform, Excite</h2><p>Now that you've captured the attention of your audience, it's time to make them feel special.In social media (just as in life), it's the little things that go a long way.Take the time to respond to questions, give feedback, and show genuine interest in your audience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822262b8b8c64ec474161_engage-social-media-_min.jpeg\" alt=\"engage-social-media-_min\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  7. Get Interactive</h2><p>Not only do you need to show interest, but also show that you care more than your own content.I follow the <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-70-30-rule_b49003\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">70-30 </a>rule. Not sure how that works?</p><h5 id=\"\">Here's the scoop:</h5><p>Share a minimum of seventy percent engaging content and thirty percent promotional.Find others sharing similar content to your own, and pass it along. It can be educational, entertaining, fun, or useful. Just make sure it's relevant to your audience.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Research and Evaluate</h2><p>Research should be the backbone of any social media strategy.Google Analytics offers a rich database of statistics and analytics that can (and should) guide your posting and strategy decisions.Leverage this information to learn as much as possible about which content has the biggest impact on your community. Evaluate how and why some content works, and some falls short.</p><h2 id=\"\">  9. Be Trendy</h2><p>Maintaining a finger on the pulse of trending topics and stories relevant to your target market should always be at the top of your to-do list.Keeping your posts timely is a surefire way to improve the organic reach of any post.</p><h2 id=\"\">  10. Don't Be Stagnant</h2><p>Take the information you cull from your analytics and adjust your strategy. Social media is fluid. This means your strategy must remain agile and flexible.Don't be afraid to change things up!</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Want to learn more about creating your solid social media strategy?

You can listen through <a href=\"http://www.google.com/alerts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google Alerts</a>, keyword research and other online tools such as <a href=\"http://socialmention.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Mention</a>.\"</blockquote><p>Spontaneous interactions on Twitter between a brand and a fan are really entertaining and fun. It gives the public a chance to get to know the brand beyond the logo and corporate spiel.It also is the mark of an innovative social media brand that isn't planning all their tweets in a war room waiting to create the next Oreo tweet. That was one person who used the timing of the Super Bowl and creativity to steal the show.Trying too hard to be spontaneous and cool really ruins the message. It ends up being like your Mom trying to use the latest slang and totally mangling it.</p><blockquote id=\"\">The X factor that boosts social media from good to fantastic is the spontaneous, human element.</blockquote><p>Using witty text, an entertaining photo or possibly something special about your brand that you can tweet or post is fun and interesting.Listening on social media and sharing what your fans share is very smart. This is the best kind of social media, it reinforces that you are a caring brand and show interest in what your client's like and share.It also features one of your clients which is generous. Highlighting the nice things your client's say about you by reposting, retweeting, or favoriting the tweet all boost your brand's online mojo.</p><h2 id=\"\">A few examples from social media out in the wild:</h2><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">From Twitter</strong></h3><p>Kimpton is a pet friendly hotel chain.

      "wp-content": "<p>When things go sideways on social media – and they will – it’s how you respond that matters.Whether it’s an accidental tweet or an overeager trigger finger hitting the post button too soon, I guarantee you’ve encountered a social media fail.</p><h4 id=\"\">But what happens next is key.</h4><p>Do you panic, frantically racing around trying to fix what went wrong?While that might work (sometimes), being proactive rather than reactive is truly the best strategy.Because let's face it --</p><h4 id=\"\">There’s rarely a positive outcome when you’re reacting to a situation.</h4><p>Typically, reaction leads to overreaction, which can quickly spiral from bad to worse to all-out catastrophe in a matter of moments.The only way to combat being reactive (and possibly combative) is to put in place a plan. A plan that outlines the how, when, where and what of any social media misfortune.Ready to put your best foot forward, no matter the social media situation?Follow this simple <strong id=\"\">three-step fix</strong> to your social media mistake!</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Fix Any Social Media Fail</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Assess the Damage</h2><p>Was the error simply a rogue tweet or random misspelling within a post? No worries!It might be as simple as leaving it be or deleting it altogether. No harm, no foul.If the damage is worse - say one of your employees shared private information in a public setting - it might take bigger steps to rectify.</p><h5 id=\"\">Take a few moments to determine:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Was anyone harmed by the content shared?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Was the content offensive?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Was any information tweeted or posted for private consumption only?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Was the content legally protected?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Was there copyright infringement?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is there a possibility that this will spiral into a bigger issue?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  2. Own the Mistake</h2><p>There’s good news and bad news when it comes to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-super-powers/\" id=\"\">social media</a> mistakes.While you can correct them, you can’t control how those affected will react.The best you can do in any situation is to fess up immediately. Whether offline or online, honesty is always the best policy.Don’t do what <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/06/16/weinergate-social-media-job-loss/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Chrysler</a> did when someone with access to their account sent out this tweet:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282225f540662c5f5d6591_chrsyler-tweet-mistake.jpeg\" alt=\"chrsyler tweet mistake\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Rather than come clean that someone within the company had sent the tweet, they first claimed their account was compromised.Dumb.If you’ve made an error, own it and don’t waste time letting everyone know. The longer you wait, the worse the situation becomes and the less authentic your apology will look.</p><h5 id=\"\">Take this course of action:</h5><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Notify all required parties within your company</li> \t<li id=\"\">Admit your mistake</li> \t<li id=\"\">Apologize</li> \t<li id=\"\">Correct the error</li> \t<li id=\"\">Move on</li></ol><p>After all, we’re only human. Mistakes will happen.You can only hope your fans and followers will be gracious in accepting your apology.If not, it's time to press forward and know that mistakes only make you stronger (and better).</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Create Your Company Policy</h2><p>The positive outcome in any negative situation is the lesson learned. That lesson is how to best handle it next time.Whether you’re a solopreneur, local business or brand, having a <a href=\"http://www.ericschwartzman.com/pr/schwartzman/social-media-policy-template.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media policy</a> in place is critical.Not only does it create a communication hierarchy, but also a systematic way to handle any issue, no matter how big or small.The goal is to put together a make-sense policy that any employee can easily follow. This will serve as a roadmap, offering guidance during a temporary lapse in judgment or social media crisis.</p><h5 id=\"\">Steps to Creating a Social Media Policy</h5><h4 id=\"\">STEP 1</h4><p>If you have employees, you must first determine what’s allowed and what’s not when it comes to social media. Be specific with your statements.<strong id=\"\">Examples:</strong></p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Prohibited social media conduct includes posting defamatory comments, pornographic images, proprietary content, or harassing statements</li> \t<li id=\"\">No exclusive or confidential company information may be posted without prior approval from senior management</li> \t<li id=\"\">Images may not be shared if you do not have copyright or ownership over the graphic</li></ul><p>If you’re the only employee, this process will be slightly easier. However, take the same steps no matter the size of your company. It’s important to spell out what is allowed and how you will handle any negative situation.Getting crystal clear on what you will tolerate and unacceptable on social media might save you from a situation similar to Kenneth Cole when a tweet attempted to use the Syrian conflict to sell shoes.</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"Boots on the ground\" or not, let's not forget about sandals, pumps and loafers. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Footwear&src=hash\" id=\"\">#Footwear</a>— Kenneth Cole (@KennethCole) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KennethCole/statuses/375673368462102528\" id=\"\">September 5, 2013</a></blockquote><p>Yikes! Did someone actually approve that tweet?If so, it better align with their mission, vision and values.</p><h4 id=\"\">STEP 2</h4><p>You now need to determine what the consequences will be for violation of the policy. Spell this out in no uncertain terms.</p><h4 id=\"\">STEP 3</h4><p>Now it's time to clearly communicate your policy with all employees or anyone affected by the new guidelines.</p><h5 id=\"\">When sharing your social media strategy, make sure to express:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What company information can be shared?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Offer examples and state what type of content or details must receive prior approval.</li> \t<li id=\"\">What language is acceptable?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How to support the current company social media strategy.</li> \t<li id=\"\">How your employees can use company logos and additional branded content, such as registered trademarks.</li></ul><p>The bottom line?Always know your limitations and share your expectations. They can save you from a lot of heartache and a messy situation.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Tell me! What's the worst social media fail you've ever seen?</em></h4>",

Five minutes, an hour, maybe even two?Your head hits the keyboard as you sigh in disbelief. How can this be happening again?If this scenario sounds familiar, you're in good company. Whether you’re facing writers block or a creative slump, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-content-that-gets-shared/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">creating compelling content</a> can feel elusive.The good news? While <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/start-a-successful-blog-in-7-easy-steps/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">writing great blog content</a> on a consistent basis can seem overwhelming, it is possible.Just take a look at some of today’s most successful writers and authors. How did they achieve the status of the best and brightest?Each one committed to honing their craft through consistent efforts. No matter if you’re a newbie blogger or looking to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/how-to-grow-a-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">improve your next blog post</a>, you’ve come to the right place.Here you’re going to learn seven steps to writing a great blog post every time.</p><h1 id=\"\">7 Steps to Writing Your Best Blog Post</h1><h2 id=\"\">  STEP 1: Make it Convincing</h2><p>The first paragraph of your post will be the deciding factor. To quote the musical group the Clash, the question on your reader’s lips is,</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“Should I stay or should I go?” (</em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oGIFublvDes\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">click here</em></a><em id=\"\"> for your blast from the past)</em></blockquote><p>You have one chance to grab your reader’s attention. Don’t miss the opportunity to craft an opening to your blog post that seizes your their attention from the moment they land on your blog.Copyblogger suggests you <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/5-simple-ways-to-open-your-blog-post-with-a-bang/\" id=\"\">open your blog post with a bang</a>:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Ask a question.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share an anecdote or quote.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Invoke the mind’s eye.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use an analogy, metaphor or simile</li> \t<li id=\"\">Cite a shocking statistic.</li></ul><p>The key is to write with your reader in mind. What will wow, excite, or encourage them? What about your post will speak to their pain, struggle, and frustration?If you're just getting started, take time to research. Look to your competition, influential bloggers, and those in your space that have built what you're eager to create.Take a look at their tone, style... the words they use (and don't use). Is it resonating with their audience? If so, why? What about it connects with you?The goal isn't to emulate their blog, but to better understand what their audience (and yours) is looking for.Now put your personality into your writing. You'll never convince people if you don't believe it. And the only way to believe in what you write is to have been there / done that. Sharing anything you haven't actually done is, well... a fabrication or to be straight - a lie.To captivate your audience, you're going to have to be straight with them. A great example of this is Michael Hyatt. Not only does he speak from the heart, but from years of experience.And it shows.He's empathetic, creating a mental picture of his audience's struggle, letting them know that he gets it. And he has the solution.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822252a7f289fc750d1f6_writing-your-best-blog-post.jpeg\" alt=\"writing your best blog post\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  STEP 2: Speak to an Audience of ONE</h2><p>I speak a lot about the importance of knowing your niche and understanding the needs of your target market.Rather than blasting your content out to a broad audience, you write with a very specific reader in mind.Speaking to an audience of one means you embrace your core audience. You define who they are in detail.Have you taken the time to consider what your typical blog reader enjoys reading and what answers they're looking for when they visit your blog?If not, let's get you into the head and heart of the person you're eager to connect with.</p><h3 id=\"\">How to Identify Content for Your Core Audience:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Put yourself in the shoes of your target market. What challenges do they face, what questions do they have, and what problems do you solve?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your competition talking about? Does that seem relevant to your audience?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Look to the Internet. Research keywords and phrases that your audience would type in if they were looking for your product or service.</li> \t<li id=\"\">When you're researching topics, think about the true intent of your audience. This is where you want to mix in traditional keyword research with the contextual search or actual intent of your reader. Put it in their words. (e.g. what someone would actually type into Google or ask Siri?)</li></ul><p>The more time you spend researching, the better you’ll understand exactly what potential readers are looking for and how you can best meet their needs.<a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-set-up-an-effective-facebook-ad-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Media Examiner</a> understands their audience and speaks solely to that group in their titles, copy, meta - every inch of their blog posts.

If a reader can’t quickly discern what you’re message is, they’ll move on with the possibility of never returning.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Format your post – use h1 through h6 heading elements, bold, italics, short and concise paragraphs, bulleted lists, graphics and other media to break up the post.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Read through your post.

If it doesn’t flow for you, it won’t for your reader either.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Edit ruthlessly!</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  STEP 5: Give it a Great Headline</h2><p>Your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/irresistible-blog-titles/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blog post title</a> is similar to any marketing headline. Readers, just like consumers, make snap decisions based on your title or headline.The goal is to draw them in through short, catchy and straightforward titles.

If you’re ambitious and want to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/best-social-media-image-sizes/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create a unique graphic</a> for each social network, you can find those dimensions here.If you're not interested in spending an abundant amount of time sizing images on your own, use a tool like <a href=\"http://relaythat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Relay</a> to do it for you.</p><h2 id=\"\">  STEP 7: Tidy it Up</h2><p>Always examine and tidy up your post before publishing. Eliminate any needless words or phrases. Keep it short and to the point, removing any adjectives or adverbs that only belabor a sentence.Run it through spellcheck and if you don't feel like sentence structure is your strength, hire a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/grow-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Virtual Assistant </a>to review on your behalf.Another tool I find extremely helpful is Hemingway. I aim for a 7-8 grade or readability score and always pay close attention to any use of passive voice or sentences that are hard to read.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822252a7f28ffcf50d1f4_writing-your-best-blog-post-every-time-1.png\" alt=\"writing-your-best-blog-post-every-time\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">*BONUS TIP*</h3><h4 id=\"\">Add a Persuasive Call to Action</h4><p>You’ve written a great post and you’re ready to go live.

Below, we'll take a look at how you can create a headline that converts, compels and produces a positive result.This post is based on a very popular article I wrote, “<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/catchy-blog-titles/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Foolproof Formula to Incredibly Catchy Blog Post Titles</a>.”Due to the conversation around it, I decided to expand on the ideas, putting together a list and infographic to help you craft your own compelling blog title!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822240da4491c98f20d81_absolutely-irresistible-blog-titles.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Unlock the Keys to Absolutely Irresistible Blog Titles - An infographic by <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com\" id=\"\">Rebekah Radice</a></p><h5 id=\"\">Embed on Your Site: Copy and Paste the Code Below</h5><p>&lt;span class=\"mceItemHidden\" data-mce-bogus=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;&lt;span class=\"hiddenSpellError\" pre=\"\"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"hiddenSpellError\" pre=\"img \"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;=\"&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;https://rebekahradice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/absolutely-irresistible-blog-titles.png&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\" width=\"540\"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlock the Keys to Absolutely Irresistible Blog Titles - An infographic by &lt;a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com\"&gt;Rebekah Radice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p><h1 id=\"\">Formula to Irresistible Blog Titles</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Make it Personal</h2><p>A blog title that speaks to a personal need or situation can be very effective.For example, “How You Can Put the Love Back in Your Relationship” not only solves a problem, but also relates to readers on an intimate level.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Make Life Easier (or better)</h2><p>Think about your product or service from the consumer’s perspective.What problem does it solve and how can you best get that point across in an easy and efficient manner?</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Encourage Action (and interaction)</h2><p><a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht\" id=\"\">Blog post titles</a> should encourage action and inspire your reader to click-through. Are you asking questions, gaining valuable insight from your current subscribers?Know what triggers that action and how you can best position your content.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Lose the Jargon</h2><p>Just because you speak in industry terms, doesn’t mean your consumer will understand it. In fact, to me it always feels incredibly off-putting.Don’t make your client struggle to keep up with you. Lose the jargon and focus instead on making your blog title one that is reader and consumer friendly.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Be Interesting</h2><p>What makes your blog post intriguing? Is it news that hasn’t been shared or a tip that readers can’t find anywhere else? Draw them in, but do it ethically.Being an avid reader myself, I can tell you how disappointing it is to read a compelling blog title only to find the content lacking. Keep your title interesting, but true to what they’ll find once inside.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Be Original</h2><p>Seems simple, right? Unfortunately, being original seems to be easier said than done as copycats abound across the Internet.My take? If you want to stand out, you must <strong id=\"\">take a stand</strong>.Put your own unique spin on blog content as well as your title. <em id=\"\">Remember:</em> there may not be any unique ideas left, but there’s always room for your unique perspective.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Be Honest</h2><p>I mentioned this point above, but it’s important enough to repeat. Slimy, spammy and deceptive never sell. At least not in a sustainable way.Always make sure your blog post title is in alignment with your content.Misleading blog post titles create distrust and frustration, two lasting feelings that no blogger wants their reader to walk away with.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Speak Directly to Your Audience</h2><p>Know your audience and do your research.  Ask yourself:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Who am I trying to reach?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What problem does my post solve?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is this topic valuable?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Would I click-through if I were the consumer?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  9. Stay on Point</h2><p>Blog titles tell a story about what’s to come. They share a brief snippet of what can be expected once inside the article.What story does your blog title tell? Is it consistent with the body of your article? Don’t allow your title to stray from the main subject of your post. Stay focused and on-point.Your readers will appreciate it and your traffic will be the better for it.</p><h2 id=\"\">  10. Be 100% Clear</h2><p>A confused mind doesn't buy. They also don't click.In a study by <a href=\"http://moz.com/blog/5-data-insights-into-the-headlines-readers-click\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Conductor</a>, five types of headlines were analyzed. Here's what they found,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"The commonality among the top three resonating headline types vs. the bottom two is that the more the headline type resonated, <strong id=\"\">the more explicit the headline</strong> was as to what the reader was going to get out of reading the article. Put another way, humans don't like uncertainty.\"</blockquote><p>Take away the uncertainty and be 100 percent clear in what you're offering.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>While there are plenty of ways to <strong id=\"\">craft a click-worthy blog post title</strong>, the ideas above should put you on the road to success!What's your top tip for writing a blog title that creates buzz?<em id=\"\">Read my original article: \"</em><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/catchy-blog-titles/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Foolproof Formula to Incredibly Catchy Blog Titles</em></a><em id=\"\">.\"</em></p>",

Stephan is a web, E-mail marketing and Google Plus strategist, the host of the “<a href=\"http://gplusspotlight.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google Plus Business Spotlight</a>,” and the author of Google Plus Pro-Tips.I've known Stephan for quite some time via social media and have come to appreciate his consistent, strategic and forward-thinking approach to business. He's a wealth of information and someone you need to know.Below is an excerpt from our time together. Listen in as we discuss how businesses are succeeding at social media</p><h2 id=\"\">Social Media and Business Strategy</h2><h5 id=\"\">Rebekah:</h5><p>Share with us a little bit more about yourself. How did you become an expert within your field?</p><h5 id=\"\">Stephan:</h5><p>I've been in the web business for 14 years now, and what I bring to the table is a full-service approach. Web development is a very fragmented business right now and oftentimes, if your business is having a WordPress site developed, you're working with a bunch of different teams.So the fact that I've been able to <strong id=\"\">provide a one-stop shop concept</strong> has been a great advantage. And what it's allowed me to do is to get out into social media and into the world of web strategy and understand what works. I also get it from a technical standpoint and can then relay that back to my clients what makes the most sense.I grew up without the Internet. When I was a kid, you had to go to the library and look in a card catalog to find something. So it's a different world, and I like working with businesses that work in the real world.I'm meeting, and talking about the online challenges faced by traditional businesses and helping them figure out how to make the online space work.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Biggest Challenge for Businesses Online Today</h2><h5 id=\"\">Rebekah:</h5><p>Talk to us a little bit about your clients. What are the top three problems that you are solving for your clients today?</p><h5 id=\"\">Stephan:</h5><p>I work primarily with smaller businesses, mainly nonprofits. Actually I have a variety of churches and religious organizations in our portfolio. And the biggest challenge a lot of these guys have is that the online world this isn't their world.You know <strong id=\"\">the Internet is not what they do for a living</strong>, and they're trying to keep up with the constant changes and things like that.Having someone who knows what they’re doing to manage your online presence and then create, implement and execute an online strategy is essential.That’s how we work on with our clients, to be that go to, to be that support.</p><h2 id=\"\">Effectively Merging Online and Offline</h2><h5 id=\"\">Rebekah:</h5><p>You and I both come from the traditional marketing world. We now work with people to transition all that they've worked so hard to establish offline and transition it into a powerful and profitable online presence.However, making that shift can be very difficult.Can you offer<strong id=\"\"> one tip to on how to effectively merge marketing mediums</strong>?</p><h5 id=\"\">Stephan:</h5><p>Think it through. You have to know what you want to accomplish and you have to then put the pieces in place to accomplish those things.<strong id=\"\">The biggest challenge right now</strong> for people is that they're being fed so much information, from best practices to suggestions tips, but they don't know what any of that means.Understand your business goal, no matter what you’re getting into, and think it through. Any decisions, whether big or small, should flow back up into your overall goals. Then you can check off against that strategy, against that goal or decision and it gives you something to evaluate.And then if somebody comes up with something new you can ask yourself how it flows into your goals and impacts what you’re trying to accomplish.You'll be more effective with your time, more effective with your money, and you'll have a better quality product at the end of the day.</p><h5 id=\"\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/breakthrough-social-media/id875541617\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Listen to the full interview and subscribe within iTunes!</a></h5><p>And connect with Stephan <a href=\"http://stephanhov.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">here</a>!</p>",

Once you do, you increase the chance your visitors stick around, take action, and return for more.A credible website builds authority, trust, and influence, whether you ask them to connect, interact or buy.In a sea of competition, how can you convince customers you're the right choice?Below are ten tips to <strong id=\"\">instantly improve website credibility</strong> and skyrocket your blogger authority!</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Instantly Improve Website Credibility</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Fresh Website Content</h2><p>When was the last time you reviewed the pages within your site? If your answer is “when the site was created,” then now is the time to update.</p><h5 id=\"\">Website Content Checklist</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Go through each page and <strong id=\"\">freshen up any outdated or redundant content</strong>.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Check for misspellings or inaccuracies. Both can be a quick credibility killer.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Add testimonials and include any case studies supporting the success of your product or service.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Keep your page content straightforward, clear, and concise. There’s no reason to belabor a point or drone on for 500 words when 200 does the trick.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Review copy on all landing pages.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"> 2. Declutter Your Sidebar</h2><p>Many newbie bloggers get caught up in the bells and whistles of WordPress plugins. Before long, the sidebar is a who’s-who of old and useless plugins.Not only do they create confusion, but plugins can also reduce your <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/10936-site-speed-case-studies-tips-and-tools-for-improving-your-conversion-rate\" id=\"\">load time</a>, and be a real drag on your website traffic.Subtract the unnecessary items from your sidebar and <strong id=\"\">only leave what makes sense based on your website goals</strong>. If conversions are it, then know what content your readers seek and provide that and that alone.Jennifer Bourn of <a href=\"http://www.bourncreative.com/strategy-for-wordpress-website-sidebar-design/\" id=\"\">Bourn Creative</a>, a web and graphic design company, recommends,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“For business websites and conversion based websites, a single sidebar is highly recommended to keep the focus on converting visitors into clients, customers, and subscribers — and getting them to hire you, buy from you, and learn from you.”</blockquote><h2 id=\"\"> 3. Keep Your Contact Information Current</h2><p>Don’t make your website visitors hunt and peck to find you. Keep your contact information up to date and easy to find.</p><h5 id=\"\">To do list:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">“Contact” should be in your main menu navigation, and an easy-to-use contact form should be found on that page. Putting roadblocks up will only keep people from connecting with you. Make it as easy as possible to ask a question or schedule an appointment.</li> \t<li id=\"\">If you’re a local business, and phone calls are crucial to your business' success, make sure your phone number is prominently placed in both the header and footer of your website.</li> \t<li id=\"\">And don’t forget your social networks. Add each of your social channels to an easy-to-find location on your website.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"> 4. Make it Easy to Navigate and Search</h2><p>Take a look at your website from a user's perspective. Is your website easy to navigate? Can you locate the content you’re looking for?Steer clear of complications and enable anyone visiting your website to follow a clear path to any and all information they seek.If not, you risk the consequences. In a study by<a href=\"Forrester Research\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"> Forrester Research</a>, it was found that,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“approximately 50 percent of potential website sales are lost because users can't find information.”</blockquote><h2 id=\"\"> 5. Be Clear in Your Call to Action</h2><p>What next step do you want your visitors to take? Don’t leave it to chance.Be clear in the step you’re asking them to take, and <strong id=\"\">empower your readers to take action</strong>.Remember:</p><h5 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Confused minds don’t buy</strong>.</h5><p>Simple, relevant, and straightforward sells.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 6. Express Yourself With a Detailed “About Page”</h2><p>Your “About” page is one of the first pages readers and potential clients will visit. Express who you are with a <strong id=\"\">detailed description of your background</strong>, skills, unique abilities, and reasons why anyone would choose to work with you.<strong id=\"\">People do business with people.</strong> Don’t be afraid to show them who you are and provide the information they need to make an educated decision.Peep Laja of <a href=\"http://conversionxl.com/website-credibility-checklist-factors/#.\" id=\"\">ConversionXL</a> puts it this way,</p><blockquote id=\"\">”People don’t trust anonymous websites. If you don’t show your photo, are you hiding something? Is it that you don’t want people to recognize you on the street? People want to look you in the eye, enable it. Always use photos of the actual staff.”</blockquote><h2 id=\"\"> 7. Post to Your Blog Consistently</h2><p>If you want readers to continue coming back for more, you need to give them a reason. Not posting consistently tells a story you don’t want told -- that you don’t keep up with your commitments.<strong id=\"\">Inconsistency destroys credibility</strong>, and can also dissuade even the most avid fan from coming back.Creating a schedule and posting consistent, quality content will lend credibility to your blog. Determine how many posts you can commit to, and then pick the day(s) you will post.Train your readers when to expect fresh content so they become accustomed to seeking it out.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 8. Provide Valuable Information and Resources</h2><p>Gone are the days of static websites. Once yours is up and running, it’s your job to continue to <strong id=\"\">be a valuable resource to your readers</strong>.Share stories, provide tips, and answer reader questions. Listen to what they say in the comments, and write about their latest concerns or struggles.Building trust happens when you give up your knowledge and years of experience. Don’t be afraid to <strong id=\"\">share your unique insight</strong> thoughtfully and constructively. This goes a long way in <strong id=\"\">building credibility</strong> and establishing you as their go-to (and trusted) resource.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 9. Consistent Branding WINS</h2><p>Have you created a consistent look, feel, message, tone, and voice on your website?</p><h5 id=\"\">If not, take a moment to ensure:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">You are strengthening your business or brand mission, vision, and values in every way possible</li> \t<li id=\"\">Every page, post, and image on your website has a clear call to action</li> \t<li id=\"\">You’ve eliminated distractions and allowed a crisp and clean user experience</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your languaging is natural and aligns with your style</li> \t<li id=\"\">The design of your website, including color, scheme and fonts, is consistent across all your social networks</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your images are professional and used legally within <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2014/03/14/insiders-guide-proper-photo-usage/\" id=\"\">copyright laws</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"\"> 10. Professional Website Design and Theme</h2><p>Everything from your website theme, design, structure, and content tells your business story. What story is yours telling?If it screams old, outdated, and obsolete, it’s time to clean house and make a change.And when you do, make sure it’s responsive. According to <a href=\"http://blog.marginmedia.com.au/Our-Blog/bid/87385/10-Mobile-Web-Design-Statistics-All-Marketers-Should-Know-About\" id=\"\">MarginMedia</a>,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“48% of users say if they arrive on a business site that isn't working well on mobile, they take it as an indication of the business simply not caring.</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Your Turn!</h3><p>How are you building website credibility and blogger authority?

Tackle Social Media “On Purpose”</h2><p>Nothing can steal your mojo quicker than leading a haphazard online life.Think about how you are managing your time spent on social media. Do you randomly post, connect, and converse?Do you find yourself stumbling around, arbitrarily liking and retweeting, or are you strategic in your actions?Social media is an incredible tool when used effectively. It can put you in the right place at the right time. It can also connect you to the exact right people. But none of this can happen if you haven’t implemented a plan.A social media strategy allows you to live your online life “on purpose.” It gives you focus, motivation and goals to work towards.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Know Your Style, Limitations, and Boundaries</h2><p>Social media offers extraordinary advantages to those willing to embrace the opportunity. It also challenges those who haven’t taken the time to understand their communication style, conversation limitations, and overall boundaries.It might surprise those connected to me online, but I have always been a very private person by nature.  Sharing what transpires in my day-to-day life has never been something that comes easy.It could be that I grew up with a father who had a prominent career and knew that any verbal vomit would severely impact his standing.  Or it might have been my initial career in radio that set me up for social media.Either way, I have a deeply embedded internal monitoring system that screams, “Don’t do it,” long before the words escape my lips or leave my fingers to hit the computer keys.Knowing who you are and what you’re willing to talk about is critical to your online success. It allows you to engage in meaningful conversations and steer clear of those that might do harm to your business or personal brand.The bottom line? Be clear in what you are and are not willing to discuss. Then do a gut a check before posting or engaging in any conversation.Will it elevate and position you in a positive light or seek to destroy all that you’ve worked so hard to build?</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Identify What Drives and Inspires You</h2><p>Social media doesn’t sleep. It’s running 24/7 and if you don’t speak to what your passionate about, what inspires and excites you, it will quickly burn you out.What do you love most about your business or niche? How do you help people and who is it that you’re passionate about serving?If you don’t place your focus on something you eat, sleep and breathe, you will easily tire talking about it.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Choose Your Outlet</h2><p>Knowing who your target market is and where to find them is an important step to social media success.Fight the urge to be everywhere all at once. If you’re just getting started or feeling overwhelmed, stop juggling an endless amount of social networks.Give yourself permission to take a step back, analyze what’s working and what’s not, and which social channel is your best use of time.When it comes to social media, success comes from baby steps. Small, sustainable steps that work you towards a bigger goal. Taking on more than you can maintain will leave you feeling defeated before you find momentum.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tools to Help You Determine Where Your Time is Best Spent:</h5><p><a href=\"http://moz.com/tools\" id=\"\">Moz Analytics</a> – This is one of my top go-to tools. While there is a paid version, they offer quite a few free tools, including social analytics.<a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/?gclid=CK78pNaF8L0CFZZqfgodqx0AKg\" id=\"\">Google Analytics</a> – Use Google Analytics to monitor your social media activity, conversions and traffic.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/insights/\" id=\"\">Facebook Insights</a> – Insights is Facebook's free analytics tool that gives you a snapshot of the activity happening on your page and around each of your posts.<a href=\"http://www.circlecount.com/\" id=\"\">Circlecount</a> analyzes Google+ activity and allows you to view everything from your follower growth to interactions including comments and reshares.While it is tempting to every social networking site, it’s to your advantage toDetermine where you’re getting the most exposure.  Focus your time and energy on that social network, master it and then move on to the next one.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Find Your Rhythm and Voice</h2><p>Finding your voice online can be the ultimate challenge. While it won’t evolve overnight, there are a few ways to discover the cadence and tone that best represent who you are.<a href=\"http://www.stephencovey.com/blog/?p=16\" id=\"\">Steven Covey</a> describes the importance of finding your voice this way,</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“One word expresses the pathway to greatness: voice. Those on this path find their voice and inspire others to find theirs. The rest never do.”</em></blockquote><h5 id=\"\">Ask yourself a few questions to begin to define your own:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What lights you up?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What could you talk about for days on end?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are you an introvert or extrovert?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do you like to share stories or tell jokes?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What are you and expert at?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What skills do you have that need to be shared with others?</li></ul><p>Need more inspiration? Give these<a href=\"http://www.accidentalcreative.com/creating/10-questions-that-will-help-you-find-your-voice/\" id=\"\"> ten questions</a> a try!</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Educate, Entertain and Entice</h2><p>As someone who wants to know the why and the how before I can get to the what, social media forces us to take a step back. It requires that we attack it from a fresh perspective.It demands that we entice through the ‘what’ and then engage and grow through the how-to.  What do I mean by this?Take those daily client questions, old marketing materials, and follow-up emails and turn them into enticing, educational, and entertaining social media posts that answer the “what” behind your business.Then share tips that explain how-to. This can be anything from solving a client concern to a story on how your product helped someone overcome a challenge.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Work It, Tweak It, Explode It</h2><p>Social media is fluid. It’s an ever-evolving medium, requiring that you become a student of mastering it both today and in years to come.Stay up-to-date on the latest changes and in touch with how those changes impact your reach, engagement, sales, traffic, and conversions.If your analytics tell you something isn’t working, don’t be afraid to tweak it.One small change can lead to explosive results.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts…</h3><p>Above all else, have fun! Social media should not be a drain or a strain on your business.Find your groove, get your mojo back and enjoy your time spent online!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Your most important online asset is your content.It attracts clients to you and encourages prospects to take action.But creating compelling content can feel elusive.You might think that writing engaging content isn't something the average business owner can generate.You'd be wrong. It is doable and on a budget!Whether you're writing for your blog or <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/creating-winning-social-media-strategy/\" id=\"\">social media</a> sites, the ideas below will help you write innovative and compelling content that gets shared.</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Create Content That Gets Shared</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Be clear in your value and intent</h2><p>Whether it’s web copy or offline marketing, talking about your business, the value it offers, and the intent behind it not only educates potential customers but also allows them to make quicker decisions.In the book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sources-Power-People-Make-Decisions/dp/0262611465\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions</em></a>, author Gary Klein states that clearly communicating intent arms people with the information necessary to get “un-stuck” by moving potential decision-making obstacles out of their way.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Analyze your competitors</h2><p>When writing content for your business, consider looking at what your competitors are writing about. By using <a href=\"http://alexa.com/\" id=\"\">www.Alexa.com</a>, you can identify which companies receive the top traffic within your industry.Visit each of their sites and analyze the top shared content. What worked, what didn’t, and how can you improve upon it?</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Know your ideal reader</h2><p>Understanding who your ideal reader is and what content they find valuable will make content creation a breeze.Begin by creating a customer persona. Describe what your perfect reader looks like, what they do, and why they would need your product or service.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Put images to work for you</h2><p>Images are an excellent way to attract readers to your content. Whether they are funny, dramatic or eye-catching, make sure they are consistent with your business or brand look and feel.Tell your story through images by adding custom designs to your blog post. Then pin them to Pinterest, share them on Google+, Facebook and Twitter.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Create attractive titles</h2><p>The titles of your articles and posts can dictate whether people click through, read it, retweet it, or share.Be creative and always keep the end-user in mind. Know what content connects with your potential clients, and craft your title around that information.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Structure content properly</h2><p>Whether you are posting to your blog or social media sites, proper structure is critical. Take a look at your last several posts — were they easy to read?In your blog posts, consider using lists. Lists are scannable and easy for those moving quickly across the Internet to quickly scan your content.With your social media posts, consider keeping them short, but exciting. Encourage conversation by asking a question or offering your thoughts around a particular topic.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Form meaningful connections to build уоur personal brand</h2><p>As you begin to create content, remember that relationships are at the core of getting that information shared.Building trust by forming healthy connections will draw people to you and your content.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Share success stories</h2><p>Every business has a story. What’s yours? Share your story in a real and relatable way.Stories connect readers and potential customers to your company. Allow them to know and remember yours.</p><h2 id=\"\">  9. Change it up</h2><p>Simply posting links to your social sites will quickly bore your target market. Change it up and intersperse links with images, quotes, questions, feedback, and any additional content that adds value to the conversation.Think of it this way: if you were having a conversation with someone face-to-face, you wouldn’t spend the entire time promoting you and your product or service.You would listen, react, and respond as well. It’s no different when you’re online.</p><h2 id=\"\">  10. Plan to succeed</h2><p>Make content creation a part of your daily marketing strategy.Build out an editorial calendar with a list of topics, article ideas, and social media posts to keep your efforts focused and consistent.</p><h2 id=\"\">  11. Share newsworthy content</h2><p>Stay up-to-date on the latest news within your industry and field. Share that content in a timely manner, offering context around it.How did you feel when you read the post? What is your key takeaway and why should your audience care?Context is every bit as important as content when it comes to sharing in social media.</p><h2 id=\"\">  12. Build an email list</h2><p>Building an email list should be at the top of your <a href=\"http://12most.com/2013/12/16/12-sensational-ways-master-social-media-year/\" id=\"\">social media</a> and content strategy to-do list in 2014. Use a subscriber list to stay in front of your audience and promote your latest blog post, campaign or product.Driving subscribers to your content not only encourages increased readership and traffic but boosts shares by staying top-of-mind.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Your turn!

Just the word can send shivers down your spine.Whether it's a fear of the camera,  failure or technology, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/using-video-to-market-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">video</a> is an often overlooked marketing medium.However, with the dawn of <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/hangouts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google+ and Hangouts on Air</a>, your ability to get \"on camera\" is more readily available than ever before.One of the best ways to use Hangouts is to raise awareness around your business or brand.There are hundreds of hangouts taking place each week. Why not identify those that are specific to your industry or area of expertise and request a guest interview?Not only can the right video interview position you as an authority, but it can also build credibility.Nevertheless, becoming a great guest and knowing what it takes to provide a perfect interview doesn't happen overnight.I was honored to join Ronnie Bincer, <a href=\"http://www.thehangouthelper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">The Hangout Helper</a> to discuss Google+, Hangouts and the power of video interviews.If you're ready to take advantage of Hangouts on Air and become the best interview guest possible, read through these top tips taken from our hour together.</p><h1 id=\"\">Use Video Interviews to Boost Business Visibility</h1><p>In the digital age where over 6 billion hours of video are watched on YouTube each month, video interviews are a marketing tool you don't want to miss out on.Not only do they offer unique insight into your business, but also an endless supply of content across your website and social channels.So, let's get you started!</p><h2 id=\"\">STEP 1: Prepare</h2><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Know your topic and focus on the key points you want to convey. Stick with three main points and don’t allow yourself to veer off-topic.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Keep your answers short, concise and  get to the point.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Avoid complex industry speak – talk as if you’re talking to someone who doesn’t understand your industry.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Ask for an outline or questions ahead of time so there’s plenty of time to prepare.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Talk through your answers, but don’t script them out. You’ll come off feeling stilted and inauthentic.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do your homework on your host and understand their audience. You’re far more effective if you can speak directly to their needs.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't be afraid to ask your host for talking points and make suggestions based on content and topic.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">STEP 2: Look Your Best</h2><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">First impressions are powerful. They create credibility and authority. Don't miss an opportunity to make an unforgettable impression.</li> \t<li id=\"\">For women, make sure your makeup is the same color as your skin. If not, you may appear pasty or pale or worse yet, the sunburned fake suntan look.</li> \t<li id=\"\">For women and men, apply powder on your nose, forehead, and face to avoid looking shiny or oily under your lighting.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Apply lip balm, but not liberally as to make you look shiny. Just enough to keep your lips moist.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pick bright, vibrant colors that pair well with your setting.</li> \t<li id=\"\">SMILE!</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">STEP 3: Presentation</h2><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Choose the right setting and make sure it's bright, open and doesn't include distracting items.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Lighting is imperative - double-check yours before going live in any interview.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Sound quality check is the same as above. Ensure that your sound is crisp and clear.</li> \t<li id=\"\">How to feel comfortable in front of the camera:</li><li> \tLook directly into the camera and hold eye contact. \t</li><li id=\"\">Don’t fidget – it only makes you look nervous.</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Lean forward, sit tall and breathe evenly.</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Use your interviewers name and speak directly to them.</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Talk to one person, not every person.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">STEP 4: Don’t Forget</h2><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Turn off your cell phone.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Shut down everything running on your computer except the HOA or video.</li> \t<li id=\"\">This should go without saying, but spit out your gum.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Sit in a comfortable chair that allows you to look directly into the camera. Keeping your audience eye-level creates a relationship rather than looking up or down which can be threatening, or worse, diminishing.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">How to Become the Best HOA Guest (and find awesome opportunities)</h2><p>I had the pleasure to not only join Ronnie, but several additional professionals on the hangout. Each were kind enough to share their best tips.If you're eager to become the best Hangout on Air guest and want to find awesome video interview opportunities, below are ways you can get started.</p><h5 id=\"\">Ronnie Bincer</h5><p>Consistently share the video from a HOA Event or the HOA Event itself with some relevant, insightful commentary 'up top' while tagging the Host and panel members. Explain in that commentary why you think the content is helpful to your followers in a way that gets the attention of the Host of the HOA.Another related idea is to follow the host you hope to connect with as they appear in other people's HOAs as a co-host or a guest. Make helpful, insightful comments in the Event stream while tagging the contact in the relevant comments. There is a good chance that this person will appear in other people's HOAs and if your comments are useful and interesting, that will likely help you get on the radar of the desired person. - <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RonnieBincer\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Ronnie</a></p><h5 id=\"\">Jeff Sieh</h5><p>I've found that the best way to be invited as a guest on a HOA is not to ask right away but provide value to the host over time.For example, a great way to be noticed by a HOA host is to become active in the comments.  If someone in the program mentions a specific link or website, be the one who finds it and types that into the comments for everyone to have as a resource.  If a guest mentions a Google Plus post that they have written, be the one who tracks it down and provides it for the audience.Don't do this one time and expect (or ask) to be invited to the next show.  Adding value with thoughtful comments, and providing a helpful service to the host and their audience on a constant basis will help you stand out to the hosts and even their guests! - <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JeffSieh\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Jeff</a></p><h5 id=\"\">Mike Allton</h5><p>Just as in guest blogging, experts who want to take advantage of the reach and audience of a successful HOA Show should first research the show and the host so that there is a basic understanding of what the show is about and the typical format.Then, compose a letter to the host that introduces yourself, your expertise, and specifically points to an article you've written or some other recent content that covers a topic you would like to address. Book authors have been doing this for decades to get on radio shows.They send a letter that says, \"Hey! I have this great new book out that is making all kinds of waves in my industry, and I think it would make a particularly interesting show for you and your readers. Here's a copy for you to check out, and I would love to book one of your future shows to come on and talk about the book and this topic and answer questions.\"So similarly, you offer the host proof (as in a blog or a book or an article or whatever you have) that you know what you're talking about and can bring to the show a new and interesting perspective on a topic or issue that is relevant to the show and viewers. If you frame yourself and your expertise properly, you will make the show host's job easy! Every HOA host is always on the lookout for their next guest and are thrilled when someone interesting and qualified approaches them. If you can come on the show and provide value, you'll make that HOA host look great, so don't be afraid to reach out and clue them in to the value you can bring. - <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeAllton\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Mike</a></p><h5 id=\"\">Debi Davis</h5><p>1) Be an active participant in live HOAs.2) Be prepared to be invited (because active participants are sure to be noticed and invited). E.g., If someone approaches you about being on their HOA, know what your key messages are; your call-to-action; your objective for being on G+. Write these things down and rehearse saying them out loud. If it feels natural, you're ready to be a guest on the panel of an HOA.  - <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DebiDavis\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Debi</a></p><h4 id=\"\">Watch the interview in its entirety!</h4><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xKVDGk0PhrA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure>",

Use Pictures to Tell Your Story</h2><p id=\"\">Pictures are powerful.</p><p id=\"\">They have the ability to persuade, motivate, mesmerize and enthrall.</p><p id=\"\">They tell a unique story, connecting viewers with your message in a compelling and impactful way.</p><p id=\"\">Whether humorous, controversial or emotional, telling your story through images can create massive results.</p><p id=\"\">Disney has always done an excellent job in connecting their brand story to avid followers.</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;3. The Rule of One</h2><p id=\"\">Did you know that in a one-hour talk, an audience can only retain one key point?</p><p id=\"\">When it comes to your graphics, limit them to one point.</p><p id=\"\">What is the one point you want to get across? Say it in a way that's compelling, creates a call-to-action, and speaks to your audience.Once you've determined your point, apply one of these rules to your post:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Offer a solution</li> \t<li id=\"\">Offer an answer to a problem</li> \t<li id=\"\">Show “how-to” do something</li> \t<li id=\"\">Encourage them to make a decision</li> \t<li id=\"\">Tell a relatable story</li> \t<li id=\"\">Inspire through “feel good” stories</li></ul><p id=\"\">A picture in social media is often-times worth more than a thousand words.

Evoke Emotion</h2><p id=\"\">There are only three reasons consumers buy.In order to sell your product or service, you must speak to a primal need.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">How to satisfy a basic necessity - food, clothing, shelter</li> \t<li id=\"\">To solve a problem - what's their concern, challenge or problem</li> \t<li id=\"\">Better themselves - better body, life, bank account</li></ul><p id=\"\">Once you understand your market, you can truly speak to their wants and desires.</p><p id=\"\">If you know what they want, you can translate that into a powerful message in a minute.

Speak in Benefits, Not Features</h2><p id=\"\">Have you ever purchased a new car? What attracts you?For me it's the shiny. The shiny new cup holder, power windows, leather seats and of course, the easy access remote key.</p><p id=\"\">So how can you speak in benefits to your clients?</p><h5 id=\"\">Here are a few great examples:</h5><p id=\"\">This toothpaste says it has stain removing properties. The benefit? You walk away with a brighter, better smile.</p><p id=\"\">A car has anti-lock breaks. What does this mean? The car will stop and potentially save your family.

You'll be able to share special moments in time with your loved ones.</p><p id=\"\">People buy based on benefits.</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;5. Use a Fabulous Font</h2><p id=\"\">From Arial to Times Roman, your font says a lot about you.</p><p id=\"\">What are you trying to convey?</p><p id=\"\">Decide who you are, what your business is about and how you want your message to be communicated.</p><p id=\"\">Are you funny, serious, casual?</p><p id=\"\">Each font speaks volumes about you and your business, putting a face and personality behind it.</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;5. Make Every Image Your Masterpiece</h2><p id=\"\">While your image might not be the Mona Lisa, it can be branded with your signature look and feel.</p><p id=\"\">Customize each image to inspire and delight your social media fans and followers.</p><p id=\"\">Ask yourself how you can make your image funny, inspirational, more informative?</p><p id=\"\">The four basic questions you must answer:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What is it?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How does it work?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Who has it?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How does it feel?</li></ul><p id=\"\">Make it a game.

She’s making a living doing what she loves. It is possible, but the key is getting focused and building a solid, but powerful foundation.</p><h2 id=\"\">  Q: What are the Building Blocks to a Profitable Blog?</h2><h5 id=\"\">1. Provide Valuable Content</h5><p>Listen to your readers. Comb through their questions and find ways to solve problems.Offering a substantial amount of value builds trust and will establish  you as the industry authority.  Remember, trust takes time and will not happen overnight.Give freely and be patient. Consistently offering  your insight, wisdom and knowledge will allow readers to see you are in it for them, not just the paycheck.</p><h5 id=\"\">2. Post Consistently</h5><p>When was the last time you returned to a blog that hadn't posted in weeks or even months? Probably never.It's difficult to consider them a viable resource when the blogger doesn't take posting seriously.Create consistency within your posting strategy. It lends credibility and will keep you in front of your readers and top-of-mind.Plan on writing at least one content rich post per week.  Then add it to your calendar and stick to it like any other appointment.</p><h5 id=\"\">3. Get Inside Your Target Markets Head</h5><p>Have a deep understanding of who your market is and what they’re looking for. Don’t assume you have the answers. Do your homework.Breakdown your top three target markets and what problems you solve for each one. For example, if parents are your target market, take a deeper dive into that niche.</p><h5 id=\"\">Your three target markets might look like this:</h5><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Parents of teens</li> \t<li id=\"\">Parents of teens with disabilities</li> \t<li id=\"\">Parents of teen drivers</li></ol><p>As you can imagine, the problems you solve for each one will be considerably different. Know exactly what those needs are and find ways to meet them in a very real and specific way.</p><h2 id=\"\">  Q: How Do You Create a Powerful Content Creation Strategy?</h2><p>My solution is two-fold.My first strategy is a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/catchy-blog-titles/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">swipe file</a>. This is a file that allows you to easily swipe ideas as you make your way across the web and save it for content inspiration down the road.This could be a blog post, a video, or podcast. Anything that grabs your attention.The second strategy I live and die by is an <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">editorial calendar</a>. I am a checklist girl and what isn’t on the list, doesn’t get done.That holds true in my business and flows through to social media.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282222a53a593f7bb36ad0_ediotrial-calendar.jpeg\" alt=\"ediotrial calendar\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  Q: How Can Graphics Drive Blog Shares?</h2><p>Graphics are an incredibly powerful tool.Take the time to create a big, beautiful graphic and post it to Google+, Pinterest and Facebook. Then tweet that graphic.According to a study by Dan Zarralla, <a href=\"http://danzarrella.com/use-images-on-twitter-to-get-more-retweets.html\" id=\"\">tweets with images</a> are 94% more likely to get retweeted than those that don’t. Don't miss that opportunity!The graphic I create for Google+ and Pinterest with a size of 800 x 1200. That takes up a lot of real estate and works extremely well on both platforms.</p><h2 id=\"\">  Q: How Can Bloggers Keep Track of Contacts Eager to Support Their Efforts?</h2><p>I have three quick tips.Each one can be used in conjunction with the others, but will depend on your overall strategy and the relationships you've built.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Twitter Lists - This is an excellent way to manage contacts. Add those that actively share your content to a list of blog supporters. Share their content on a consistent basis. This builds awareness and generates reciprocity.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Google+ Circles – As you post an article, ask who would like to be included in your Google+ shared circle. Then notify that circle each time you write a new article.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create an excel file with your top business advocates. Reach out to each one personally and thank them for their continued support. Let them know when you post each week and ask if they would be willing to share.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  Q: How Can Google+ Communities Boost Blogger Awareness and Drive Additional Shares?</h2><p>Google+ communities are a wonderful way to connect with like-minded bloggers.Be very mindful of community guidelines and get to know the community before you begin posting.It’s extremely important to understand what the do’s and don’ts of each community so tread lightly.Most will allow you to share your own content as long as it doesn’t resemble <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/02/18/what-is-link-litter-and-how-to-avoid-it/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">link-litter</a> where you simply drop a link with no context or explanation around it.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">How are you building a powerful and profitable blog?

Then begin to comment and interact with other community members.Just like face-to-face networking, building community relationships requires you to take an interest in those involved.Ask questions, share relevant content and spend time taking part in conversations. This will build your reputation and establish you as an authority within your area of expertise.However, beware of how you share.

      "wp-content": "<p>Ever wonder what makes a good blog great?Why one blog connects, inspires, and motivates readers while another falls 0n deaf ears?It's simple.Successful bloggers never give up.They persevere through the difficulties and have an unshakable hunger to succeed.They are constantly tweaking, updating, and modifying their content and approach.Below are six well-known phrases that will inspire you to greatness.How to improve your blog by becoming a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/leverage-blogging-build-business-identity-authority-credibility/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">better blogger</a>.</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Become a Better Blogger Today</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Say What You Do and Do What You Say</h2><blockquote id=\"\">“You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do.” ― C.G. Jung</blockquote><p>This mantra has always held a special place in my heart. As business owners, it’s critical to not only say what you’re going to do but follow it up by doing exactly what you said you would.But, this phrase has taken on a somewhat different meaning in the online and blogging world.Think about this. How many blogs have you visited that attempt to pass off someone else’s thoughts in a brand new package? Rather than speaking from experience, they mimic what others “say they do.”There’s no quicker way to burn a bridge or break trust than offering a skewed version of reality. Stop trying to be something you’re not or a version you believe others want you to be. Write about what you know, and then practice what you preach.We live in an online world where authenticity and transparency are a requirement.It will be difficult to maintain that facade if you’re not writing blog content based on fact, experience, or first-hand knowledge.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. If You Can’t Stand the Heat, Get Out of the Kitchen</h2><p>Let's face it. Building a successful blog isn’t easy. It takes time and a steadfast commitment to overcoming adversity.There will be challenges. Between hosting issues, WordPress glitches, rogue plugins, and content that fails to meet the mark, running a blog can leave the sanest person running for a padded cell.Know your capacity to manage stress and surround yourself with those who can support you when things go sideways.And if you can’t handle the stress, it might be time to get out of the kitchen.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew</h2><p>Stop feeling as if you need to keep up with the Joneses. Your competition is not you.Set realistic <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/write-blog-content-people-want-read-share/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">goals for your blog</a> and know what you can commit to. There's no need to compare you to someone else. Their goals are not yours.Stay focused on your daily and monthly metrics. Is it more traffic you want to gain? Determine what steps you'll need to take to reach your short-term and long-term goals.Then go after it, as my friend Sabrina would say, \"like you're angry at it!\"</p><h2 id=\"\"> 4. Jack of All Trades, Master of None</h2><p>Similar to my first point, a “jack of all trades and master of none” blogger is someone that has lost their way.They’ve decided to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/write-blog-content-people-want-read-share/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">write blog content</a> about everything and anything instead of focusing on one main topic.Don’t be distracted by shiny objects.Determine who your blog is speaking to, and then stay the course.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Stop Tooting Your Own Horn</h2><p>Want your readers to keep coming back to your blog time and again? Stop dispelling your virtues and start sharing what matters most to them.Can you imagine walking into a networking event and running around the room shouting your own praises?Of course not!That would be pretty boring, right? Maybe even annoying.Get to know your readers and for goodness sake, stop making your blog all about you.Learn what’s important to your readers, and then share valuable information that speaks directly to their questions and concerns. Ask what they want to see more of and how you can best serve them.Taking a genuine interest in your readers goes a long way in building the know, like, and trust factor.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Go the Whole Nine Yards</h2><p>You have to take a stand if your goal is blogging for business.Either go all in or get all out. <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/Q4L0e\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Tweet This!</a>You can't have it both ways.To succeed in anything, you must be willing to do the hard stuff. The not-so-fun stuff.Pushing through and finding a solution on the days when your blogging feels in vain will only serve to bring bigger and better results.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">What's your top tip for becoming a better blogger?</em></h4>",

Identify Goals and Objectives</h2><p>The words goal and objective are often confused, especially when it comes to social media marketing. While they both relate to what you want to achieve, they differ in the how, when, and what.Think of it like this: the goal is what you are working towards; the objectives are the steps you will take to get there.For example, if you run a social media marketing blog, your goal might be:</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“Become the industry destination for all business professionals seeking tips, tools and strategies that support the successful use and implementation of social media marketing within their business.”</em></blockquote><h4 id=\"\">In order to achieve that goal, your objectives might look something like this:</h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Hire ten social media experts to share real-life case studies that clearly substantiate the value of social media use for business</li> \t<li id=\"\">Join three top networking groups to increase visibility and awareness of the blog and it’s purpose</li> \t<li id=\"\">Drive targeted traffic to the blog</li> \t<li id=\"\">Increase blog subscription conversion by twenty-five percent</li></ul><p>Your goals and objectives will vary dependent on your mission, long-term and short-term vision, audience, and product or service.The important thing is to take the time to outline your top goals. Those goals, that when achieved would propel your business forward.Build out your goals with this <strong id=\"\">social media strategy worksheet</strong> from <a href=\"http://www.exacttarget.com/sites/exacttarget/files/How-to-Develop-a-Social-Media-Strategy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Exact Target</a> by Sales Force.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282222a53a59853db36acf_social-media-strategy-worksheet.jpeg\" alt=\"social media strategy example\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Create Bite-Sized Action Steps</h2><p>Now that you know what you’re working towards, break those goals and objectives down into manageable action steps.In other words, how will you get from:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Point A (implementation) to</li> \t<li id=\"\">Point B (execution) to</li> \t<li id=\"\">Point C (conversion)</li></ul><p>Based on the goals and objectives above, the <strong id=\"\">action step</strong>s required might be:</p><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Utilize the top six social media channels – Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and LinkedIn to create an integrated social media marketing campaign that supports growth. \tUse various forms of content to get company message positioned properly on each social network.</li><li> \t</li><li> \ti.

Tweak posts to meet the needs of each social channel fan and follower base.</li></ol><p><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Next step:</em></strong><em id=\"\"> </em>Now that you know what you are trying to achieve, put a plan in place to monitor key metrics. For example:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Referrals from social channels</li> \t<li id=\"\">Leads coming from Facebook page</li> \t<li id=\"\">Mentions across social media</li> \t<li id=\"\">Audience/community growth</li> \t<li id=\"\">New blog subscribers</li></ul><p>Now build it out in a basic spreadsheet.

Begin to interact by commenting or posting interesting content at least once per day.</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">Twitter</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Go through monitored keywords (e.g. industry terms, business name, local keyword phrases) and respond to any tweets</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use third-party tool such as Social Bro to follow relevant people back</li> \t<li id=\"\">Thank retweets</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use lists to follow key people within industry or niche</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">LinkedIn</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Update status once per day</li> \t<li id=\"\">Accept relevant invitations</li> \t<li id=\"\">Provide 1 recommendation where appropriate</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">Pinterest</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Share three to five pins and add them to strategically named boards</li> \t<li id=\"\">Repin three others pins that followers would fight interesting</li> \t<li id=\"\">Find five new people within industry, field or niche to follow</li></ul><p>Setting up a proper strategy on the front-end will reduce many headaches down the road.Take the time to strategically design and implement your social media strategy, then determine how you will stay consistent in your efforts.The important thing is  to know your limitations and what you can commit to without over-extending yourself.

      "wp-content": "<p>As an entrepreneur and business owner, juggling a never-ending amount of to-dos comes with the territory.But did you know that managing too many tasks can hurt your business?Not only do you miss out on the opportunity to work at your highest and best, but also the gift of focused energy.If you’re ready to expand and <strong id=\"\">grow your business</strong>, it’s time to think beyond yourself.This was the topic of discussion when I joined <a href=\"http://ontracktips.com/\" id=\"\">Jason Wiser</a> on his show, “Get on Track, Stay on Track.”In this fast-paced interview, we discuss how to find, hire, and train your first virtual assistant. Below are Jason's questions, followed by my thoughts and our conversation.</p><h1 id=\"\">Hiring a Virtual Assistant</h1><h2 id=\"\">  Q: Why Hire a Virtual Assistant</h2><p>I left my brick and mortar business for good back in 2008 and made the transition to a home office with a business that functioned solely online.I thought I’d make the move, go it alone for a while, and then re-hire down the road based on need.This was a big mistake and one you don't want to make.Don't wait to hire until you feel the timing is perfect. There is never a perfect moment to expand your business.While adding a team member might feel scary, think of what you’re losing by not:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Sleep</li> \t<li id=\"\">Family Time</li> \t<li id=\"\">Peace</li> \t<li id=\"\">Joy</li> \t<li id=\"\">True Fulfillment</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  Q: What Can a VA Do for You?</h2><p>Anything you don’t want to do or quite frankly, shouldn’t be doing. It could be anything from monitoring and managing email, to creating landing pages for your website.In “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Everything-You-Can-Youve/dp/0312284543\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Getting Everything You Can Out of All You Got</a>,”  Jay Abraham says...</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“a marketing genius is someone who is both logical and prudent. Someone who only follows the path that produces the highest and best results or returns for their time, money and effort.\"</em></blockquote><p>That statement was an eye-opener for me. I was trying so hard to get ahead, but wasn’t willing to let go. As a recovering perfectionist, I held onto everything so tight that there was no room for growth.If this is you, I encourage you to stop holding yourself back.Chris Ducker, a virtual staffing expert, has put together one hundred and one <a href=\"http://www.chrisducker.com/101-tasks-to-outsource-to-virtual-staff/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">tasks you can give away</a>. Read through this list, pick a few, and get started.</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“You like doing certain tasks, you might be good at doing them. The question is, should you BE doing them, as the business owner?!!” Chris Ducker</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  Q: What Was Your Biggest Mistake?</h2><p>Hiring one person for everything. I realized many years ago that I needed to stop looking for the perfect person and hire based on the role or skill and not the task.Just as with social media, one size does not fit all when it comes to virtual assistants.For me, it took time to break down what each role looked like. Was this a person that would assist with Wordpress design, content creation, social media marketing? Looking for people with specific skill sets was the key to unlocking the power behind VA’s for me.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong> Q: Keys to VA Success?</h2><p>Know your processes and be very specific. Take the time on the front-end to properly train your VA so you can continue to serve your clients at the highest level possible.There will be growing pains as with any new undertaking within your business, but putting in the time to map out the steps, and set expectations will save you from future headaches.</p><h2 id=\"\">  Q: How to Get Started?</h2><p>In order to expand and grow your business, you must begin to give specific pieces of your business away.Look at every facet of your business and determine where your time is best spent.Break down your daily duties and then whittle it down to the top two or three tasks that if solely focused on would explode your business. Then give away the rest!</p><h2 id=\"\">  Q: Cost for a VA?</h2><p>This truly depends on who and what you are looking for. The cost could be anything from fifty dollars per week to several thousand dollars per month.</p><h2 id=\"\">  Q: How to find a VA?</h2><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Ask for referrals from friends, peers, and other reliable resources</li> \t<li id=\"\">Follow Virtual Assistants online – Twitter has been a great resource for me</li> \t<li id=\"\">Start with a reputable online community like <a href=\"http://odesk.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">ODesk</a></li> \t<li id=\"\">Use website such as <a href=\"http://virtualstafffinder.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Virtual Staff Finder</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  Key Takeaways</h2><p>Hiring a <strong id=\"\">virtual assistant</strong> and truly making the most of the relationship will require that you get out of your own way.Take down the roadblocks that stand between you and success.If you truly want to grow your business and create a sustainable business model, you need to hire professionals that can walk alongside you.Commit to scaling your business beyond yourself!</p><h5 id=\"\">Watch the show in its entirety:</h5><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/GwtycYqZQBw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure>",

Optimize Your Profile</h2><p>Proper <strong id=\"\">profile optimization</strong> is something I often see overlooked. Unfortunately, without this step, any other Google Plus tactic you put in place won’t be near as effective.Take the time to share all of the juicy goodness that is you. Express who you are, what you’re all about, and who are you passionate about serving.With Google Plus tied directly to Google search, make sure to use your keywords and those terms you are eager to rank for within your profile.There is a considerable amount of real estate within your Google Plus “About” section. Use this space to include details about your special skill set, training, certifications, and other defining qualities that differentiate you from the competition.Add links to your website and other pertinent online information. You want anyone that lands on your profile to have the ability to:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Instantly identify with you are</li> \t<li id=\"\">What product/service you offer</li> \t<li id=\"\">How you can solve their problems</li> \t<li id=\"\">Make an educated and informed decision</li></ul><p>Next step? Get your Google Plus cover photo optimized! <a href=\"http://www.websighthangouts.com/google-plus-cover-photo-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Stephan Hovnanian</a> put together an excellent how-to with step-by-step instructions.Tip 1: Use keywords in your cover image’s filename (example: <em id=\"\">google-plus-cover-template.jpg</em>).Tip 2: When you upload the cover photo itself, give your cover photo a description/caption, and be sure to include keywords as well as a link to your website.Tip 3; Share the image as a photo post on Google Plus.</p><h5 id=\"\">Watch the video here:</h5><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CrC7DZ8ZxDQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Get Active</h2><p>Start posting consistently and begin to cross-promote your proprietary content.Did you write a post that was well received? Post it to Google Plus with context around your content. Express what it is about the topic that really fires you up and why your audience should care.Keep in mind, <strong id=\"\">Google Plus is not Facebook</strong>. It takes time to find your voice and build momentum. You must be willing to put in the time and effort to build a name, reputation, and community.It’s also a very unique platform in how the members view both individuals and brands. Influence does not automatically transition from one social network to the next. This is a distinct mentality that I truly appreciate. The community dictates that you prove your value and worth before trust is offered.</p><h5 id=\"\">The best way to do this?</h5><p>Show up on a consistent basis and offer a ridiculous amount of value to your followers.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Join Communities within Your Industry or Niche</h2><p>[caption id=\"attachment_6355\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"257\"]</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221bbde7a78a7a83ce7c_google-plus-communities.jpeg\" alt=\"closing the google plus gap\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p> Want to Learn More About Google+? Join our Thriving Community![/caption]Communities were an excellent launch pad for me. I was able to immerse myself in an environment that was speaking my language.With <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/how-to-make-google-communities-a-part-of-your-social-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google Plus communities</a>, you can connect with people that have similar interests, goals and desires.Similar to Facebook groups, Google Plus communities offer your business an opportunity to build, foster, and maintain relationships.</p><h5 id=\"\">Simple Ways to Get Started with Communities:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Find communities that are centered on your industry, niche, or hobby.

And you must do it in a short amount of time.According to <a href=\"http://www.howtofascinate.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Sally Hogshead</a>, author of \"Fascinate,\" you have nine seconds to command attention.However, in a recent <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">study</a> by the National Center for Biotechnology, it seems even less than that.It was found that the average attention span of consumers is a mere eight seconds.That is four seconds less than it was in 2000, and one second less than a goldfish<strong id=\"\">.</strong>Yep, that's right. A goldfish.Based on that, it appears our attention span is actually devolving. A frightening thought, especially for business and marketing professionals eager to gain the eye of today's fast-paced consumer.So how can you \"win the moment\" (one of my favorite Sally'isms) and be unforgettable? Below is how!</p><h2 id=\"\">  1. Develop a Consistent Look, Feel, and Message</h2><blockquote id=\"\">\"If you don't define yourself online...someone else will.\"</blockquote><p>Defining and consistently sharing your unique message in a way that is both relevant and valuable to your target audience is crucial.Not only does it create differentiation, but it allows you to share your special skills and talents in a language that speaks directly to your audience.This means that you develop your online message, voice, look, and feel and then deliver it consistently and without fail. From your website design to social media channels, ensure that each one is synonymous with who you are offline.Someone who has done an excellent job in building a sensational personal brand is <a href=\"http://www.marieforleo.com/2012/07/create-brand-find-voice/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Marie Forleo</a>. Marie's spunk and feisty personality are seen in her website, social properties, adorable wardrobe (because no girl is complete without one) conversations, content, and even her body language.It's all there, consistent from one end of her brand to the next.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822222b8b8cfd7a474159_marie-forleo-personal-brand.jpeg\" alt=\"marie forleo personal brand\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Success in <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/failing-to-build-an-online-personal-brand-heres-why/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">personal branding</a> is blending everything in a way that leaves no doubt in the mind of a consumer who you are, no matter which social or online property they land on.Whether you are an entrepreneur, small business owner, trainer, speaker, or writer, controlling the perception in and around your personal brand is not something you should take lightly.To better <strong id=\"\">understand what differentiates you from the competition</strong>, answer a few questions.</p><h5 id=\"\">Keys to Differentiation</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What do I love to do every day?</li> \t<li id=\"\">If I could only do one thing every day, what would it be?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What are my greatest strengths/weaknesses?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What do I do better than anyone else?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What separates me from the competition?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What pain, need or concern can I solve for my potential client(s)?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  2. Build Out a Captivating Social Profile that Converts</h2><p>Social media profiles are an enormous opportunity to present your story and message in a real and relatable way.They also speak directly to the search engines, so do your homework and know how potential clients are searching for you when online.Peg Fitzpatrick, does an excellent job utilizing every bit of the \"about\" space offered by <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/11/15/getting-social-on-google-video/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google+</a>. Want to rock your social media profiles and bio? I asked Peg for a few tips to get you started.</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"Google+ provides you with the most real estate of any social media profile. Be creative and let people know who you are with some smart text, then add links to your blog and other places that you write, followed by links to all your other social media profile.\"</blockquote><p>As you can see, Peg follows her own advice.Her bio is full of details that not only make her relatable, accessible, and authentic, but also tell a story to search engines and humans alike.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822222b8b8cdd3d474158_peg-fitzpatrick-google%2B.jpeg\" alt=\"peg fitzpatrick google+\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h5 id=\"\">A few additional ways to Optimize Your Profile:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Drop the pretense and have a little fun. Write your summary in an authentic way that allows people to understand what you do, what you have to offer and what you are passionate about. Conversations happen when you share interesting facts and tidbits that pull back the veil on who you truly are.</li> \t<li id=\"\">A professional profile image – Your profile image should be considered a key element to your personal brand. For this reason, it is extremely important that you create consistency from one network to the next by using the same high-quality professional headshot.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use relevant keywords in a conversational and organic way. Understand what terms people are searching for when researching your business, niche, product, or service. Work those in to your profile in a way that is conversational and easily scannable. Google is eager to help you tell your story, but without your keywords you could create a situation where consumers have to hunt and peck to find you.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Get local – As you craft your summary, remember to add your industry specific keywords as well as your location based keywords including city and state.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't forget your call to action! Never leave the next step or follow-up action to chance. Do you want people to click-through to your website, your latest product or your book? Tell them! Share details that answer the \"what's in it for me question\" and a link so the next step is effortless.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">   3. Find Your \"One Thing\" and Spread it Like Wildfire</h2><p>In the 1991 movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101587/quotes\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">City Slickers</a>, Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) is facing a cross-roads. He's thirty-nine, fearing a mid-life crisis, and eager to find meaning in his life.Curly, a gruff cowboy played by Jack Palance, shares a few words of wisdom with Mitch that are as relevant to life as they are to business.<strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Curly:</em></strong><em id=\"\"> </em>\"Do you know what the secret of life is? One thing, just one thing. You stick to that and everything else don't mean $%@!\" Watch it here:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/2k1uOqRb0HU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><p>Just as Curly forced Mitch to figure out his \"one thing,\" I'm going to encourage you to do the same. What is the one thing that pushes you forward in your business, drives you daily, and gets you up and out of bed?If you can figure out your \"one thing,\" everything else will fall into place.When you live and work in your sweet spot, that place that challenges, excites, and inspires you, anything and everything is possible.Find that one thing and then live it, breathe it, and shout it from the rooftops - every day!</p>",

Your content is the glue that gets them to stick around.While both are equally important, you  must first get them to walk through the front door.As Neil Pattel of <a href=\"www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-copywriting-chapter-3/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">QuickSprout</a> says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">The goal of the headline is to stop readers cold and <em id=\"\">draw them into your post</em>. You can’t do that if you use cute, clever or confusing headlines. You can stop readers cold, however, if you write headlines that are unique, ultra-specific, useful or urgent.</blockquote><p>Don't settle on the first iteration of your title. Work with it and test it. A tool I love to use is the Advanced Marketing Institute's \"<a href=\"http://www.aminstitute.com/headline/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Emotional Marketing Value Headline Analyzer</a>.\"Simply plug in your title, choose your business or industry, and hit submit. Within seconds your title be scored based on an algorithm that tests the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual value of your headline.As you can imagine, the higher the number the better. Keep tweaking your title until you feel comfortable with it, and you feel you've gotten the most out of it.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822060da449a524f20ba4_test-blog-post-headline.jpeg\" alt=\"test blog post headline\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Tip No. 2: Optimize for Maximum Exposure</h2><p>While search engine optimization has taken somewhat of a back seat to social media optimization in some marketers minds, it's certainly not dead.Proper optimization of your blog post can get search engines (particularly Google) and your target audience to pay attention.Write about <strong id=\"\">current topics that are relevant tо уоur industry</strong> and make sure you post this content consistently. Not only do the <a href=\"http://moz.com/blog/taking-advantage-of-googles-bias-toward-hyperfresh-content-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">search engines love fresh content</a>, but it will keep your readers coming back  for up-to-date information.As you write your blog content, also <strong id=\"\">think about the keywords</strong> that your target market will be using. As you can see below, my post \"<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/ways-to-promote-your-latest-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">25 Smart Ways to Promote Your Latest Blog Post</a>\" is ranking on the front page of Google based on the search \"blog post promotion.\"Include your keyword in your title if possible and then add them throughout your post. However, don't get carried away.  The days of keyword stuffing for search engine placement are long gone.The most important ingredients that will keep readers coming back is the readability and conversational tone of your content. If you are simply writing for search engines, you will have readers running (not walking) away from your blog altogether.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222169d01c3f67092f0e_blog-post-promotion.jpeg\" alt=\"blog post promotion\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Tip No. 3: Create а Video</h2><p>Did you offer a tip in your latest blog post that is worth sharing in a different format? Take that tip and turn it into a quick video.Just make sure your video is worth watching аnd sharing. The sound and visual should be high quality and you want to kеер іt short аnd get tо thе point. People will not stick around if your sound quality is poor or you ramble on with no particular point.Using blog content in a short video is an excellent way to showcase your talent and expertise by arousing viewer interest. Give them enough to want to learn more!</p><h2 id=\"\">Tip No. 4: Create a Google+ Hangout</h2><p>While video marketing might be hot, creating your own TV show is even hotter. But why make it difficult? Give Google+ Hangouts on Air a try!Google+ Hangouts on Air (HOA's) are a terrific way to position your personal brand as the go-to professional within your industry. As Stephan Hovnanian of <a href=\"http://www.websighthangouts.com/google-plus-hangouts-personal-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">WebSIGHT</a> said in a recent article,</p><p id=\"\">\"We all know YouTube has its share of amazing “shows” where individuals have taken their webcam and turned themselves into superstars. Now, there’s a new wave of “hosts” coming on board, and they’re using Google+ Hangouts On-Air (HOA’s) to create a ton of exposure, not just for themselves, but for their guests as well.\"\"If you are personable, know something about something, and can look into a webcam, you should be participating in Google+ Hangouts On Air.\"</p><p>As consumers' appetite for content grows, offering an alternative to traditional marketing allows you to reach a larger and broader audience.A Google+ hangout has greater visual impact, emotional appeal and reach given the active social nature of these events. Whether you decide to run your own or join one, grab the opportunity to put your business or brand in front of this growing audience.</p><h2 id=\"\">Tip No. 5: Join Blog Networks</h2><p>Do you write content only to find that only a handful of people have read and shared it? Let your post get in front of a much larger audience through blog communities.Blog networks are a great way to establish relationships with fellow bloggers actively writing  about your niche or topic.One of my favorite communities is <a href=\"http://triberr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Triberr</a>. I use Triberr to build alliances and assist other bloggers in spreading their content across the web. It's simple to use and highly effective when used strategically.Sign up and join Tribes that share content similar to yours. You can share across multiple networks immediately or set up an automated system to drip content to your social sites.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222169d01ca5d8092f0f_how-to-use-triberr.jpeg\" alt=\"how to use triberr\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Tip No. 6: Utilize Social Bookmarking</h2><p>Social bookmarking sites serve two purposes. They allow you to collect and manage content and share your content with a group searching based on your keywords.Sharing your latest blog post on social bookmarking sites such as the ones below can open your content up to millions of potential viewers you would not have access to otherwise.Make this a must-do each and every time you publish a new post!A few of my favorites:</p><h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"http://reddit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Reddit</a></h3><p>Reddit is a unique social bookmarking and social news website with a very unique community. Search by “sub-Reddit’s” that act as categories.</p><h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"http://scoop.it/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Scoop.it</a></h3><p>Sccop.it is a bookmarking and curation website where you can create magazines based on topic or niche. Add content from across the web to your Scoop.it account and let others begin to find you based on similar interests.</p><h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"http://stumbleupon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">StumbleUpon</a></h3><p>StumblUpon is a bookmarking and discovery engine that allows users to “stumble” through related content. Add your latest blog post to your StumbleUpon account, categorize it based on topic and let others stumble to it based on interest.As you can see from my post below, it can be an incredibly effective traffic-driving tool!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222169d01c794c092f0d_stumbleupon.jpeg\" alt=\"stumbleupon\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Tip No. 7: Turn Your Post into a Podcast</h2><p>Another way to to take your blog post and get it in front of a whole new audience is to turn it into a podcast.If уоu аrе lооkіng to boost your website traffic, thеn соnѕіdеr adding a podcast to your marketing mix.Once you have written a blog post, chunk  it down into your top tips or key takeaways. This will be recorded so that anyone can listen, whether they are in the car or the treadmill.Your post and your podcast will now cross-promote one another and support each other in driving additional traffic and new subscribers to your blog.One of my favorite podcasts is Pat Flynn's, \"<a href=\"http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/category/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Smart Passive Income Podcast</a>.\" Pat says that launching his podcast is one of the best decisions he ever made and hearing the results below, I would have to agree.</p><p id=\"\">\"The show has surpassed <strong id=\"\">6,000,000 total downloads</strong>. (as of December, 2013) and has become the #1 way <strong id=\"\">people who read my blog</strong> found out about me – that’s above search, social media and links from other websites.\"</p><h2 id=\"\">Tip No. 8: Write a Follow Up Post or Create a Series</h2><p>Do you have articles that you have written in the last year or two that have an evergreen quality, but have a few key points that need updating?Let your readers know that since you wrote the original post that there have been many changes you want to make them aware of.Stop the churn and burn. There is so much great content sitting on your blog. There is no reason to reinvent the wheel when you can update an old article in 30 minutes or less.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222169d01ce057092f0c_maximize-your-blog-content.jpeg\" alt=\"maximize your blog content\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">I'd love to hear from you!

Stay Relevant</h2><p>Post relevant, insightful, and informative content on a regular basis. What's new in your industry?Keep your finger on the pulse of what's hot and share that along with your thoughts around the topic. Create a conversation through compelling content!</p><h2 id=\"\">  2.

Build Credibility</h2><p>Ensure that уоur information verifiable, reliable аnd a direct reflection of your products аnd services.There is never a time when inaccurate or misleading marketing is acceptable.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4.  Share Tweetables</h2><p>Make your posts and tweets shareable. The more pertinent, insightful, and targeted your content, the more likely your followers and fans are to share it.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5.

No one wants to be talked \"at.\" They want to be talked \"with.\"Listen and then engage in conversations important to those that follow you.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6.  Get Social</h2><p>Social media is a two-way conversation. If you are going to make the most of your time on social media, you must be interactive.Ask questions, share your thoughts, and offer feedback that shows you are truly interested in the conversations happening around you or your business.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Build Relationships</h2><p>Take your conversations one step further and begin to build relationships. It is poor social etiquette both offline and online to simply blast out a message.Don't put up a brick wall of content between you and your followers. Ensure that you are accessible and quick to respond.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Start Talking</h2><p>Get out and engage!

      "wp-content": "<p>Your blog is a powerful online resource.It can build your personal brand visibility, authority, and credibility.Whether you're a new blogger or just looking to crank up your results, my interview with <a href=\"http://donnamerrilltribe.com/2014/01/%EF%BB%BF3-lies-blogging-gurus-will-tell/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Donna Merrill</a> will give you three quick tips for new bloggers to get found and grow fast!But first, let me introduce you to Donna. She's an Internet Marketing veteran, and a woman who has used her blog to build a thriving business.She’s also a ball of fire, enthusiastically embracing everything she attacks.As she puts it,</p><blockquote id=\"\"> “I was born and raised in Brooklyn, U.S.A., of Italian descent in an Italian neighborhood.   I’m spunky!  You can take the girl out of Brooklyn, but you can’t take the Brooklyn out of the girl! “</blockquote><p>I started following Donna’s blog many years ago for several reasons. Donna is knowledgeable, well-spoken, and incredibly engaging. She is also down to earth and a lot of fun.She was a blogger I immediately connected with, enjoying her ability to take a topic like blogging and express the ins and outs in a way that was easy to consume and easy to understand. That’s a talent that not many bloggers have.It was with this in mind that I asked Donna to provide three things every new blogger needs to do...right now.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!</p><h1 id=\"\">Tips for New Bloggers to Grow Your Blog Faster</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Find Your Passion</h2><p>Focus your blog on something you are passionate about.  Your passion should help you clearly define your niche, or specialization.You should definitely blog about things you are passionate about.You will find it easier to write about your special interests than anything else.  And you will be able to come up with ideas for articles, and write them more convincingly when you are truly interested in the material.</p><h5 id=\"\">Let me give you an example of this.</h5><p>Let's say your biggest passion is for health.  Then, you narrow that down to a health drink that you think is really great.  It might even be a drink that you are selling as part of a health business you are in.You like selling this health drink because it has worked wonders for you.  Now you are so darn passionate about it that you want the entire world to know that this stuff works!That's what it looks like to <strong id=\"\">blog within your passion zone.</strong>Just a word of caution about a blog closely aligned with a product you sell.  Always remember something called the \"Pareto principle.\" This dictates that your posts should be 80% pure content and only 20% promotional.With that in mind, you can't just write an article saying \"This stuff works!\" That looks like a 100% sales pitch, not an information piece that gives value to readers interested in health.If health is your passion, attract readers interested in health to your post.   If you want to promote a product, such as your favorite health drink, you can.  But only occasionally.Generally speaking, write informative articles in the health related field about 80% of the time.  Write about good food, exercise, anything you want, as long as it is within your niche.  Once in a while, no more than 20% of the time (or less), you can offer relevant products and services to your readers.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2.  Join Blogging Groups And Alliances</h2><p>Your blog could look like a graveyard if you don't figure out how to get people reading it and involved in commenting and social sharing!There are many Facebook groups in your niche, as well as Google+ Communities.  You should share your blog posts there, so that people start visiting your blog.But you can jump start this process by joining blogging groups and alliances with other bloggers.  As a group, these bloggers are committed to visiting your blog, commenting o your posts and sharing them on their social sites.  In turn, you are required to do the same for them.  This is a process known as reciprocity.</p><h5 id=\"\">Here is how reciprocity works:</h5><p>You write your blog post.  Someone in our blogging alliance visits your blog and comments on your post.  You answer that comment in a \"reply\".  Then you go over to their blog and read it, leave a good comment.You go one further step and share it on your social sites.  You will notice that most blogs have social share buttons.  All you have to do is press one and share their content and you are good to go.Now, here's a super way to get some engagement going.At the same time that you share someone's article on Facebook, go over to their Facebook profile and \"add them as a friend.\" ALWAYS do this with an attached message, like \"I would like to add you as my FB friend, so I can syndicate your blog further on this platform.\"Repeat this process on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+ or anywhere else you like.  You will be surprised how grateful people are when you do this.When you join blogging groups, engagement starts.  It's really that simple.You will slowly get to know people and they will come to know you.  This is how your blog will grow organically.Remember: this won't happen overnight, but over time.  Give yourself the time to follow this process consistently over a meaningful period (like 60 or 90 days), and you will see great results.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3.  Manage Your Social Sites</h2><p>Properly managing your social activity on social sites is critical to getting your blog recognized and talked about.But social sites can also be a time-trap that keeps you from engaging in other important aspects of blogging.  It can also overwhelm you to the point that you lose perspective of your overall game plan… promoting your blog.Here are some ways to <strong id=\"\">make your social sites a benefit too</strong>, instead of a distraction from your blogging.When you are on social sites, limit the time of your visits.  Try to create certain times of the day where you can post something social as a tweet or status update.Never… I said never post a \"Buy This\" kind of message.   You will quickly see people running away from you instead of being attracted to you.  Social sites are just that… social.  Don't treat them like roadside billboards.Limit the time you spend on each social site to a pre-determined amount of time.  Maybe 10 minutes a day on Facebook, three times a day, for example.  That way you won't get sucked in to endless chatter, but will focus your efforts on meaningful posting and conversation that builds engagement with people, and showcases your skills, personality and, of course, your blog.It doesn't really matter what your preferred schedule is, just be sure to create a time schedule for yourself.  Otherwise, you will look up from your keyboard only to find out that it's time for bed!  Don't let that happen to you.Create certain times of the day to post something on Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Then go back a few hours later.  See who has responded to what you posted, say a quick thank you or continue the conversation.  I personally like to do this 3 times a day.  Morning, afternoon and even late night to keep in touch to my friends on the other side of the world.I hope these tips have helped you understand that the key to blogging successfully is to just get out there and do it.  Make friends and share your passions.  Eventually, you will develop a look, feel and \"brand\" that others will come to recognize and appreciate.Dedicate your time and effort to this process.  Never expect things to happen overnight.  And most of all, share your self and your information sincerely and generously.  Giving is always more important than receiving in life, and it's no different that when you are trying to establish yourself as a blogger.</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Are you using Pinterest to cross-promote and grow your business?If not, you're missing an opportunity!A unique, image-based networking platform, <strong id=\"\">Pinterest is a tool designed with the creative marketer in mind</strong>.Below are 7 ways to use Pinterest for business and support your additional online and social media marketing efforts.</p><h1 id=\"\">7 Creative Ways To Use Pinterest for Business</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Custom Product</h2><p>Create a custom board that showcases a specific product. Pin various images, including a description that tells the story behind the product.You will pin images from your blog, website, Facebook, Google+ page, or even landing or marketing page. Each pin will then create a link back to the original content, cross-promoting that particular channel.Let's say you sell coffee makers. We’re going to use this example due to my love of coffee and my almost compulsive need to find the “perfect” machine. So, humor me.You have done your homework and know exactly who your target market is and what they’re looking for. You are now going to share that knowledge through Pinterest boards.What are the unique features or accessories that make your product special? (e.g. pause and serve, integrated pods, built-in grinder or permanent filter)Pin those images and make sure your board name identifies exactly what you are trying to convey. It might look something like this, “How to Make the Perfect Cup of Coffee.” Do you think a few people are searching based on that exact question? I would say yes!</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Featured Pinners</h2><p>This idea draws upon your followers as well as past and potential clients for content. If you suspect you already have a loyal following who would love to help spread the word about your product or service or you know that you have fans actively pinning content from your website, ask if they would like to pin to a group board.A group board allows you to add members who can then begin pinning content directly to your board.<strong id=\"\">There are several benefits behind this strategy:</strong></p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">You have a small “marketing team” pinning on your behalf</li> \t<li id=\"\">Every time they or anyone pins to the shared board, followers of that pinner will see that content thereby extending your reach</li> \t<li id=\"\">This content is created and customized for your audience</li></ul><p>Contests or sweepstakes always present a great cross-promotion opportunity on Pinterest. Since Pinterest is a visual platform, pinning the creative produced for your giveaway along with a call to action allows you to promote your sweeps while boosting visibility of your various other social or online properties.Whether you are running a contest on Facebook or a sweepstakes on your website, use Pinterest to drive traffic to that site. How? Besides pinning your contest graphic, consider pinning:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Contest guidelines</li> \t<li id=\"\">Little known facts about your giveaway</li> \t<li id=\"\">Answers to FAQ about your prize (what does it do, who does it help and how will it make the consumers life better)</li> \t<li id=\"\">A timeline of events if you have multiple giveaways during your sweepstakes</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  4. Market Research</h2><p>Do you frequently analyze market data and provide valuable insight to consumers? Turn that data into eye-catching images, Infographics and data-driven creatives.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Videos</h2><p>Are you creating how-to, educational or informational videos that are housed elsewhere on the web? Well, get pinning!Showcase your videos by <strong id=\"\">creating specialty Pinterest boards</strong> designed to provide an easy way to categorize and sort your videos so clients can easily locate what they are looking for.Does a pet grooming company offer <strong id=\"\">simple how-to videos</strong> that pet owners can use at home? Break those down into unique boards that are <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/boost-seo-with-pinterest/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">SEO optimized </a>for optimal exposure. What does this mean? Take your time making your title as true to the “what” behind your videos. That is, what will the consumer find, get out of and benefit from your videos.Again, as a pet grooming company, you might have boards called:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Pet Training Videos</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pet Potty Training Videos</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pet Leash Training Videos</li></ul><p>You catch my drift. Make it as easy as possible for anyone searching and stumbling upon your Pinterest page to know exactly what type of content you offer.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Coupons</h2><p>Do you offer daily coupons promoting a special service or feature within your business? Pin it!Create a board that includes past and present coupons. Why? It allows new followers to see what type of coupons you have offered in the past and gives them a clear sense of whether or not they want to keep up with future offers.It also allows you to pin new coupons and share that link on Twitter, Facebook and Google+ to drive traffic back to Pinterest. The goal is to create a board that becomes your “coupon hub.”</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Local Content</h2><p>If you are a local company frequently writing content designed for your city, neighborhood or community, give it a boost by pinning it to Pinterest.Create a local board that shares training or workshops taking place in your office, presentations or events you will be holding in and around the city, events you are hosting or supporting within the community, local hotspots or favorite sights to see.Excellent content is all around you. Giving it a second life on Pinterest creates fresh momentum by providing an “evergreen” hub to house it in.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">How do you use Pinterest to creatively cross-promote your business?</em></h4>",

      "wp-content": "<p>To successfully capture the attention of today’s busy online consumer, you must effectively woo <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/are-you-dating-your-prospective-clients/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">potential clients</a>.Much like dating, consumers want to be courted by your company long before you shove a product or service down their throat.Just think back to one of your first-date experiences. Without some courting and wooing, rounding first or second base would have been impossible.In fact, even attempting to “make a move” might have sent your date heading for the hills.While social media might make consumers more accessible than ever before, pouncing on the opportunity without understanding their needs is a huge mistake.Not only do you need to know your customers, you need to help them truly fall in love with your business.I recently joined <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+WadeHarman/about\" id=\"\">Wade Harman</a> on his weekly Google+ Hangout, focused on relationship marketing, social media, and building connections online and was inspired to dive deeper into the thoughts shared between <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JeffSieh/posts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Jeff Sieh</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LanySullivan/posts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Lany Sullivan</a> and I on the show.Below are three C's critical to using relationship marketing effectively within your business: conversation, communication and community.</p><h1 id=\"\">The 3 C's of Effective Relationship Marketing</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Create Meaningful <em id=\"\">Conversations</em></h2><p>Relationship marketing, often defined as “relational versus transactional”, marketing strives to put the relationship between business and consumer at the forefront rather than as an afterthought.No longer an accepted practice to simply push out a marketing message, businesses and brands are now expected to create conversation and establish rapport through their social channels.It requires that you move away from the transactional mindset, and instead work to create meaningful, intelligent and worthwhile relationships that go beyond a LIKE, share or comment.It’s what Jay Baer calls “<a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/integrated-marketing-and-media/is-youtility-the-future-of-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Youtility</a>.” It’s the ability for brands, businesses and entrepreneurs alike to infuse humanity into the sales process and tie interest to action.It’s taking a promotional post or tweet and turning it on its head. Making it useful instead of promotional. Creating a conversation instead of simply pushing out a message.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. <em id=\"\">Communicate</em> Value</h2><p>Instead of looking at your product or service and saying “what,” look at it and ask “who?” Who can I serve, help, give a little bit more to as opposed to what can I sell them today? I guarantee, the who is what will inspire engagement and ultimately, the action to purchase your product or service.Marketing expert <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_on_sliced_bread.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Seth Godin</a> often asks his readers what the value of social media is if your message is dry, generic and boring? The idea behind his message is to create differentiation rather than simply conforming to what others are doing online.</p><h4 id=\"\">If you want your message to connect, create impact and spread, you must communicate your value in a way that sets you apart.</h4><p>Relationship marketing allows you to not only start the conversation, but also join the conversation. By doing this in an authentic way, you can offer a substantial amount of value simply by showing up on a daily basis.If you can offer information аnd vаluе bеуоnd whаt іѕ сurrеntlу аvаіlаblе, уоu wіll bе embraced, appreciated, аnd financially rewarded.On the other hand, if you choose to regurgitate thе ѕаmе tired message others are spreading, then you will quickly fall оut оf favor.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Embrace Your <em id=\"\">Community</em></h2><p>Relationship marketing isn’t necessarily just about building relationships. It’s about nurturing and improving upon them.Be a catalyst for change within your industry or niche. Step outside the norm and embrace your online community.Identify who they are and how you can raise the bar when it comes to your customer service. Determine who your supporters, promoters, and raving fans are.</p><h5 id=\"\">Now ask yourself:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What do they like?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What do they need?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What problems do I solve?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How can I continue to be of value?</li></ul><h4 id=\"\">The goal is to move away from the days of simply building relationships and into an era where we ARE the relationship.</h4><p>What do I mean by this?</p><h5 id=\"\">Strive every day to give more, share more, do more, BE more.</h5><p>That in a nutshell is relationship marketing.Watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTubfdMq9_8#t=560\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Relationship Marketing</a> Google+ Hangout in its entirety.</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Bad habits. All bloggers have them, but few know how to overcome them.Whether it's overcoming a ho-hum attitude towards content creation or a non-existent posting plan, bad habits can kill momentum and crush the hope of even the most optimistic blogger.Nevertheless, if уоu wаnt <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/ways-to-promote-your-latest-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">results frоm уоur blog</a>, you must commit to beating the bad habits below.They are killing your blogging mojo!</p><h1 id=\"\">5 Bad Blogging Habits Killing Your Blog Mojo</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Believing that More Equals Better</h2><p>I believe we're seeing a shift from the \"more is better\" mentality to a less is more stance. What do I mean by this?As marketers race to keep up with the insatiable appetite of online consumers, there becomes an increasing need to pump out more and more content.However, when quality is sacrificed as the quantity picks up, you begin to break down the credibility, trust, and reach you worked so hard to build.Nile Flores with <a href=\"http://blondish.net/art-blogging-building-sturdy-foundation/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Famous Bloggers</a> puts it this way, and I couldn't agree more...</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"Slow and steady – that’s what you need to build a good foundation. People who brag about being able to post more than 1 (blog post) a day will usually run into a lull and have to eat their words.\"</em></h4><h2 id=\"\">2. Focusing Solely on SEO</h2><p>How do you determine what to write about on your blog? You're missing the boat if it's solely based on keyword research and search engine optimization.With the latest algorithm change called <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-the-keyword-what-you-need-to-know-to-stay-ahead-175531\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hummingbird</a>, Google is once again flipping the tables on writers and marketers alike.While SEO was designed to enhance a business's online visibility and traffic, many found the system easy to game. Certainly, Hummingbird will not eliminate these keyword stuffers and optimization cheaters, but it will reduce the amount of worthless content popping up across the web.The trend today is SMO. This is social media optimization and integrating a substantial and influential social media presence.How does that translate into your social media marketing strategy? According to Wishpond, \"The <a href=\"http://blog.wishpond.com/post/67575277462/seo-vs-smo-whats-the-difference-and-why-should-you\" id=\"\">Hummingbird algorithm</a> values quality content that is relevant, authoritative, and shareable. So the more your content has been shared across social media, the higher its perceived quality, and the better you’ll rank on Google.\"As a social media strategist, this news makes my heart go pitter-patter. So what does this mean to you as you craft your content?As my friend Peg Fitzpatrick said in her recent article, <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/10/09/goodbye-seo-hello-smo-social-media-optimization/\" id=\"\">Goodbye SEO, Hello SMO</a> (Social Media Optimization)...</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"The bottom line is: be yourself. Write about your passions, and share your interests. People will love it!\"</em></h4><h2 id=\"\">3. Using Images Haphazardly</h2><p>If you want to grow your blog and connect readers to your content, you need to get serious about your chosen images. Don’t use pictures within your posts haphazardly. Be strategic and thoughtful in how you choose to display and present each image within your content.</p><h5 id=\"\">Begin by answering two questions:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Do your graphics tell a great story?</li></ul><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Are you actively sharing them across your social properties, such as Pinterest and Instagram?</li></ul><p><em id=\"\">Hint: both should be answered with a resounding YES!</em>In our visually addicted online world, pictures are literally worth a thousand words. Consider this thought from <a href=\"http://rainonatinroof.com/2013/03/how-to-grow-your-blog-with-pinterest/\" id=\"\">Jenna</a> at Rain on a Tin Roof when it comes to using Pinterest to expand your blog...</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"Having great photos will not only help grow your blog through Pinterest, but it will keep readers interested in your post and other posts on your blog.\"</em></h4><p>Whether on your blog or throughout your social channels, allow your images to tell your target market the story that will connect them to your personal brand.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Not Speaking Directly to Your Target Market</h2><p>Go back and review your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/leverage-blogging-build-business-identity-authority-credibility/\" id=\"\">blog content</a>. Can readers easily identify what your message and your motivation is?Don't leave landing that next client or earning your next reader to chance. Spell out who it is that you help and how you can assist them. Give details and be specific.Readers have landed on your blog for a reason; give them the information they are looking for. <a href=\"http://www.reviewzntips.com/bad-blogging-habits/\" id=\"\">Daniel Sharkov</a> of Reviewz ‘n’ Tips puts it this way...</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"Every blogger out there has a lot more interests than just blogging. Of course, there is nothing bad about it. One just needs to keep in mind that the business blog he owns is NOT a diary, and therefore it should be kept clean of everything else.\"</em></h4><h2 id=\"\">5. Posting Without a Plan</h2><p>If your last blog post went live over one month ago, you are obviously lacking consistency.Make your blog a part of your marketing plan and a strategic resource for boosting website traffic and business profits.Create an <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" id=\"\">editorial calendar</a> that maps out your monthly topics and article titles. This moves you out of the stressful last-minute panic attack that comes each time you wait until the last moment to write a post.This type of \"fear - frustration - overwhelm\" writing schedule leaves you exhausted and burnt out.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">So tell me: what bad blogging habits will you drop to kick your efforts into high gear?</em></h4>",

However, it's important to abide by <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2014/05/19/how-to-build-thought-leadership-linkedin/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">LinkedIn best practices</a> and avoid being viewed as spam.If you're sending requests to connect, do not send one without adding a custom message. Sending the standard LinkedIn message does not explain who you are or why you want to connect.The LinkedIn default message states, <em id=\"\">“I use LinkedIn to keep track of my professional network and would like to add you.”</em> You would be wrong if it sounds like an easy way to quickly send random new connections an invite.Take time to identify who you want to connect with, and be thoughtful in your intentions to connect.

It's a long and exhausting process.But it's also worth every minute, especially if you want to share your expertise on a subject important to you.If you've considered turning your skills into a handy step-by-step for anyone interested in learning, here's 3 reasons why you should get started today!</p><h1 id=\"\">3 Reasons Why You Need to Write a Book Now</h1><h2 id=\"\">Why Write a Book?</h2><p><a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/08/19/how-to-get-people-to-fall-in-love-with-your-book-using-social-media/\" id=\"\">Writing a book</a> allows you to transfer your expertise, rich experience, and distinct life lessons to something that will most assuredly outlive you.A book becomes a living testament to all that you have learned along your journey, and says, “Hey world, here’s a few things I know and thought you might appreciate.”</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“When you speak, your words echo across the room. When you write, your words echo across the ages.” – Bud Gardner, Chicken Soup for the Writers Soul </em></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">Why a Book Builds Your Personal Brand</h2><h2 id=\"\">  1. Authenticity, Sharing ,and Why it Matters in the Online World</h2><p>If you are a blogger, you know the rush that comes with writing and then receiving your first comment or social share.It’s exciting to know that your work somehow touched someone to the point where they would take the time to engage or pass it along to their community.A book is a way to extend that “feel good” mojo with a whole new group of people.Think about it this way. You have the opportunity to transfer the amazing wonder that is you into a living, breathing document. It is your chance to share your authentic self and place it in front of an audience that desperately needs your insight, direction and unique perspective.You are the gatekeeper to that information. If your voice can somehow help others to grow, prosper and live a better life, why wouldn’t you want to share that gift?</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"A book is a physical souvenir, a concrete instantiation of your ideas in a physical object, something that gives your ideas substance and allows them to travel.\" - Seth Godin</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  2. Positions You as the Go-To Expert</h2><p>With the inception of the Internet, almost everyone has become a supposed expert. This makes writing a book an excellent way to establish yourself as a true authority within your field.With a book behind it, you will likely be viewed as the “go-to” expert, increasing your visibility and extending your reach.Not only is it a platform to showcase your special skills, but also a way to share your personal story.A book puts your intellect on display, and not in an arrogant way.Plus, think about this.Elevating personal brand awareness within your specialized niche means doors of opportunity begin to swing open.Imagine what could be if you allowed yourself to work towards what ought to be.</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“If you wait for inspiration to write; you’re not a writer, you’re a waiter.” – Dan Poynter</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  3. Increases Credibility</h2><p>With increased visibility and a boost in authority comes credibility.It can also help you gain the competitive edge in your field, positioning you as the recognized and trusted advisor within your field.Let me ask you this...When you are ready to make a large purchase decision within your own life, who do you look to? Someone with an established track record or someone unknown?The person likely has shown that they excel in their specialized field.Writing a book reinforces the fact that you know your stuff.</p><h1 id=\"\">Making the Decision</h1><p>Writing a book is a major decision and shouldn’t be taken lightly.However, if writing a book is your dream, then putting it off only prolongs the inevitable.While I know that life can get in the way and that writing a book can easily get pushed aside, I also realize what a boon persevering and seeing your dream through can be to your business and personal brand.Whether it's a huge success or a personal victory, writing and publishing your book can make all those long nights worthwhile.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Ready to write your book?

An opportunity to elevate a conversation, foster community and challenge the status quo.It is also a place for heated debate as was the case yesterday.<a href=\"http://socialmediahat.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Mike Allton</a>, a social media and Internet marketing consultant and Google Plus evangelist, shared an article that instantly ignited a heated discussion between the Google Plus community and the author of the article.Now before you make the assumption that I am going to launch into a diatribe against the author, let me put your mind at ease. That is not what this article is about.It is meant to extend the conversation beyond the \"walls\" of Google Plus and discuss the pros and cons of the evolution taking place in and around social media as a whole.</p><h1 id=\"\">The Great Debate: Google Plus vs Facebook</h1><h2 id=\"\">The Article and Why it Launched a Frenzy</h2><p>The article, \"<a href=\"http://inklingmedia.net/2013/12/12/future-facebook-open-letter-mark-zuckerberg/#.UqprHWRDvWJ\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">The Future of Facebook’s Newsfeed: An Open Letter to Mark Zuckerberg</a>,\" was a well-written piece by Ken Mueller that (in my opinion) was spot-on in his advice to Facebook.How should they attack future changes to the social giant?In a nutshell, Ken's advice was to \"stop tweaking\" and let users create their own experience. To that I say, AMEN!Where the conversation took a turn was around his comments that Google Plus is neither social, nor a place to find potential clients. To that I say, phooey!Let me give you my side (and that of many others) when it comes to both platforms.</p><h2 id=\"\">Change and Why It's Not Always Good</h2><p>Social media is all about the experience and our ability to create a virtual space that both complements, accessorizes, and expands our offline activities into a vibrant and interactive online space.The problem with that is this. Facebook is now limiting our ability to do just that.It is controlling our actions, interactions and inevitably, the reactions of our potential customers.The latest changes to the <a href=\"http://www.postplanner.com/organic-reach-of-facebook-pages-may-plummet/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook algorithm</a> and newsfeed prove that the \"free\" use of Facebook marketing may no longer be a viable way for businesses to reach consumers.In an Adage article this week, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed that the overall organic reach of Facebook posts from brands is in slow decline.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"We're getting to a place where because more people are sharing more things, the best way to get your stuff seen if you're a business is to pay for it,\" he said.</em></h4><p>As Facebook openly encourages Page owners to buy ads to extend reach, I have to wonder how many companies will make the decision to move away from Facebook marketing altogether in 2014?So what does this mean to you?It will be more difficult than ever to get seen in the newsfeed. Frustrated by your lack of interaction? It would appear that you haven't seen anything yet.</p><h2 id=\"\">My Comments and Your Takeaway</h2><p>On the flip side, Google and it's social network Google Plus continue to implement change that is both exciting and intriguing from a marketer and content creator point of view.Lets tackle Kens theory that Google Plus is not a place where consumers are spending their time.<a href=\"http://www.websighthangouts.com/business-ready-googles-semantic-search/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Stephan Hovanaian</a>'s response was well-thought out and thought provoking:</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"Here's my question: you say you want to </em><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">fish where the fish are</em></strong><em id=\"\"> and to that I ask: is Google a big enough sea for you? Because that's where people go when they want to buy something.\"</em></h4><p>They search for it. Google+ is Google. Google is search. Search is where people go to buy. Buying is what makes your clients money, which they then reinvest in your services.Given the fact that Google Plus is indeed \"Google,\" what role does the search giant play in getting your business found online?Mark Traphagen, the Director of Digital Outreach for <a href=\"http://www.virante.org/blog/2013/09/18/google-plus-posts-search-results-causes-ranking/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Virante</a> Inc. performed an experiment that provided significant insight.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">\"A G+ post I created for a specific keyword and then asked people to engage the crap out of eventually did rank high for that keyword, but 20 days after the post creation and engagement occurred!\"</em></h4><p>Take a look and then tell me which you will choose.Semantic search and organic reach or a platform requiring your hard-earned cash in order to gain the attention of your current fans?Below was my response to the difference I see between the two platforms.But don't get me wrong.I still love Facebook as a place where I can interact with my friends and family. For that, it's a wonderful way to stay up-to-date and connected to those I care most about.</p><p id=\"\">I am the first one to admit, I was not an early Google Plus adopter and did not beat the G+ drum initially.I didn't understand the draw and like many, didn't find value in the community. WOW was I ever wrong.Not only has it been an excellent resource on a local level, but the exposure within my industry is unlike anything I've experienced on any other social network.With Google Plus, I control my own destiny. Not so with Facebook. Between the dilution of organic search and the suppression of posts, Facebook is reducing even further what ability businesses had to get in front of their audience.Google Plus on the other hand is all about the quality of your content, your ability to network and how willing you are to connect, engage and inspire others through your words and actions.If I have to play on someone else's playground, I'd rather do it where I at least have a say in how (or if) anyone else gets to play with me.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">So what say you? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments in the below!</em></h4><p>For those wanting to see the complete <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107499215004519214139/posts/Qs8ZXqrw1WJ\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google Plus</a> post, you can read it here.</p>",

Looking for ideas to design a graphic that attracts attention and encourages clicks?It's not as hard as you might think to create captivating Pinterest images.And if you've been on the fence wondering why you should add your content to Pinterest, here are a few reasons:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Share additional details about your service or product</li> \t<li id=\"\">Guide your followers towards the purchase of a product</li> \t<li id=\"\">Give them a reason to follow a call-to-action to download an E-book or subscribe to a mailing list</li></ul><p>The sky is the limit! You just need to get started.Below are 4 ways to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/nstantly-improve-your-pinterest-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">make your images eye-catching</a>, interesting, and highly shareable!</p><h1 id=\"\">Create Pinterest Images that Get Shared</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Make Your Description Irresistible</h2><p>Many people think that since Pinterest is more about images than words, words don’t matter, but they do.Most users notice the image and then the description. Ensure you create a simple description of your image to clarify what your image is all about.This does not mean you should add a sea of words to your images. Include a few descriptive words to help users get the essence of your image.A good way to go about it is to ensure your Pinterest description is as optimized as possible to grab the attention of people looking for the type of content on your image.Look at <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/159526011783477389/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">this Infographic</a> I recently shared. It's an example of creating a unique description that's optimized for social as much as it is SEO.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282220f47c9597ed3e051c_create-pinterest-images-seo-tips-ideas-1100x1286.jpeg\" alt=\"create-pinterest-images-seo-tips-ideas\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">   2. Include a Captivating Call-to-Action</h2><p>Another great way to ensure your image is shared is to include a prompt on the image itself. You can inspire users to click on a link to a website for more information or add words to encourage users to read content on your blog.Whatever you decide to include as a call to action, avoid using too many words that might discourage or draw attention away from your image.As with any marketing opportunity, your goal is to captivate the attention of your Pinterest followers.This pin from <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/470626229800879315/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Entrepreneur.com</a> does exactly that. The word \"goldmine\" makes me want to know what I'm missing out on.I'm ready to click and find out!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282220f47c95e54a3e051b_create-pinterest-images-that-people-share-692x1100.png\" alt=\"create-pinterest-images-that-people-share\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">   3. Change Up the Look and Feel</h2><p>Using different colors, shapes, and lengths is another great attention grabber.Long Infographics often grab attention, but shorter graphics can also command attention if they have the right design, layout, content, and color.Keep in mind that it is wiser to keep an image longer than wider with the ideal width being 600 pixels. The sweet spot for <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-pinterest-images-that-drive-massive-results/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pinterest images</a> is 600 x 900.Not only does it work perfectly for Pinterest, but it looks beautiful on Google+.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282220f47c9585a23e051d_best-pinterest-image-size-661x1100.jpeg\" alt=\"best-pinterest-image-size\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">   4. Encourage Pinning</h2><p>Many users are discouraged from sharing images due to copyright issues. If you want them to share yours, let them know you readily encourage this.You can include Pinterest sharing buttons on your blog or website. You can also include text such as “feel free to share” to let them know that they can share your images without infringing on any copyright issues.There are multiple ways to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-pinterest-images-that-get-shared/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create shareable Pinterest images</a>.

Define Your Shine</h2><p>Defining and consistently sharing your unique message creates differentiation. It is an identifier, relaying the special skills, talents and magic that is the brand called you.Whether you are a writer, a marketer or a small business owner, controlling that perception is vital. Begin to develop your personal brand by asking a few questions:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What is my greatest strength/weakness?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What unique ability do I bring to the table?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What differentiates me from my competition?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Am I innovative or traditional in thinking?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How do I prefer to communicate?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What are the needs of my consumer that I can solve?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  2. Find Your Voice</h2><p>There is a lot of talk in the online world about \"finding your voice.\" If that term leaves you scratching your head, let me clarify.Finding your voice simply means taking your special qualities, those things that make you magically and wonderfully you and then expressing them in a tone that is true to who you are.In essence, it is translating what makes you awesome, translate that across your social networks in a real and authentic way.Remember, social media moves at a rapid pace. If you are not a direct reflection online of who you are offline, your message will get blurred and sharing that message unfailingly becomes very difficult.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Share Your Story</h2><p>In our often chaotic and hectic online world, slowing down and taking the time to take people on your journey is critical. A great way to give potential customers a more intimate look into your business is to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/using-video-to-market-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">use video</a>.Share who you are, what you are all about it, and who you can help. Offer tips, advice, updates and relevant content in a short, easy to consume format.Not only does <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/03/19/how-to-rank-on-the-first-page-of-google-through-videos/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google love video</a> making it great for SEO purposes, but embedding YouTube videos into you website increases views and personalizes the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Establish Your Brand Look and Feel</h2><p>Your look and feel is the visual definition of your online brand. From your website to your social networks, your online presence should express a consistent theme.This includes your logo, website, blog, and any images shared on social media. In fact, images are an enormous opportunity to connect fans to your brand.Whether it is a picture promoting your latest blog post or a custom image around your most recent product, stay true to the look and feel that best represents your company.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Be Descriptive</h2><p>In the online world, what you say is almost as important as what you don't say. To stand out, you need to stand up and make people take notice.But choose your words wisely!Be descriptive when sharing details about you and your business in a positive, upbeat and expressive way. People love hearing about your many successes, awards and wins within your business.Descriptive words and phrases stimulate interest by appealing to the five senses.Expressing how something makes you feel or how you see something acts as a conversation starter. Not only can it  work to bond readers and potential clients to you and your business, but it offers unique insight into what makes you tick.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Remember:</em> the traits that define you also distinguish you from the competition.</h4><h2 id=\"\">  6. Embrace Your Unique Abilities</h2><p>Social Media platforms are an excellent way to share your message, your talents and special skills on a daily basis. Love to help local businesses with their offline marketing? Don't just promote it, but share how you can help their specific needs.I know it can be hard to toot your own horn, but sometimes it's a must. When you're <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/creating-winning-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">using social media for business</a> purposes, you must be clear in what you bring to the table. Always the answer the why behind potential client questions.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Why would they want to work with you?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Why choose you over the competition?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Why is your business the best fit to fulfill their needs?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  7. Create a Memorable Experience</h2><p>Take a moment and think about the last experience you had with a business or brand. What stands out in your mind and how did it make you feel?Creating a memorable experience allows customers to emotionally connect with your business. It's a personal connection that taps into the five senses we discussed above.Why is this important? Because...While there is always a lot of talk about exceeding client expectations, creating a memorable experience is so much more than that.It requires that you have a deep understanding of who your clients are, how you can best serve them, and how you will provide what they need, when they need it.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Captivate, Engage and Inspire</h2><p>You only have a few moments to capture someone's attention, so what you say better be captivating and engaging.Take a look at the homepage of your website, your \"About\" page, and each social media bio. Does it feel stiff, unfriendly and ooze of marketing speak? Give it a refresh and work to infuse your personality into every word you write.People connect with people. Make sure you are giving enough information away about you and your business that they want to connect with you from one online property to the next.</p><h2 id=\"\">  9. Stay Current and Relevant</h2><p>Times change, industries change, people and their needs change.Make sure you consistently review your online properties; including your website, blog and social media sites.Update any out-of-date information, and dust off your about page and bios. Keep your verbiage fresh and relevant to your target market.</p><h2 id=\"\">  10. Variety is the Spice of Life</h2><p>Just because you found your voice and defined your brand look and feel, does not mean you can't change up your presentation from time to time.Social media is fluid. Therefore, your marketing methods must be agile and willing to adjust to change.Displaying different sizes and colors of the same product is known to attract clients who will come back for more and therefore differentiating your brand from others.</p><h2 id=\"\">  11. Be Available and Accessible</h2><p>When was the last time you did a website review? How easy is it for potential clients to connect with you, ask questions, or follow you on social media?Allow anyone landing on your website to know exactly how you prefer to connect online and what the best form of communication is when it comes to contact.There's nothing worse than sending consumers on a hunt-and-peck mission to track you down. More than likely, they'll leave your website frustrated and eager to move on to your competition.</p><h2 id=\"\">  12. Study Your Competitors</h2><p>Learn from the best!Whether on a local or national level, there are so many businesses and brands who are making a huge impact on social media. Learn who your competition is and spend time identifying what sets them apart.Study the good and bad. How are they leveraging social media, and where is your opportunity to outshine your competition online?</p>",

Social media offers visibility unlike any other marketing medium.Given the power of <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/improve-social-media-results/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a>, wouldn’t you agree that it is critically important for businesses to not only get social, but also implement strategies and processes that support scalability, efficiency, and successful social engagement?I would say YES!</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Create a Winning Social Media Strategy</h1><p>This last week, I joined a weekly webinar to help business professionals <strong id=\"\">boost their personal brand visibility through the power of social media</strong>.The turnout was overwhelming, with over six hundred marketers logging in to listen as I shared <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media strategy</a> for business.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. Know Your Target Market</h2><p>Social media usage varies from demographic to demographic. Take the time to research and understand exactly how, when and why your target audience uses social media.It is also vital to identify a target demographics’ preferred social media platform, so that your strategy can be focused and direct.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Take the Time to Craft Your Content</h2><p>Before diving in and creating content online, carefully think through the message and goal of each post.Whether it is a Facebook post or blog article, every word you write should support your end goal.Is your goal to drive traffic towards your latest product? Maybe you have a service that you are spotlighting this month. Whatever the case, do not lose sight of the end result you are working towards.</p><h5 id=\"\">Hint: A content calendar is the key to a consistent strategy! Take a look at this awesome article from <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/09/30/how-to-get-organized-with-an-editorial-calendar-its-easier-than-you-think/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a>  to help you design yours.</h5><h2 id=\"\">3. Create a Cross-Platform Strategy</h2><p>The most successful companies leveraging social media are expanding their influence to several platforms.Apart from being on Facebook and Twitter, they're enriching their brand with Instagram, Pinterest, Google+ Tumblr, blogs, and LinkedIn.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Keep Your Branding Consistent</h2><p>When setting up accounts on different social media networks, ensure your logo, color scheme, fonts and graphics are consistent.You want to ensure your personal brand is easily identifiable, no matter where people connect with you.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Mix it Up</h2><p>Don't just stick with the same old \"picture with a caption\" format.The best social media strategies mix tactics when it comes to posting, whether the content is a link, image, or text only.Try changing things up and incorporating infographics, quotes from your latest post or answers to questions. The objective here is to generate content that people will interact with by clicking on it, commenting, or sharing it with their friends.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Engage Your Audience</h2><p>Once you begin to catch your audience's attention, make sure they feel special.Respond to comments, soothe concerns and answer questions. It is important that you stay consistent in your messaging and maintain a professional demeanor.</p><h2 id=\"\">7. Follow the 70-30 rule</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-70-30-rule_b49003\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">70-30 </a>rule follows this strategy: maintain seventy percent engaging content and thirty percent promotional.The seventy percent should be fun, interesting, and useful to the online user. Let your audience engage in the conversation, rather than feeling as if they are being \"sold\" every time you post.This keeps your audience interactive and engaged, so that when you promote, they are far more likely to value whatever information comes their way.</p><h2 id=\"\">8. Check Your Analytics</h2><p>Research should be the backbone of any social media strategy.Google Analytics offers a rich database of statistics and analytics that can (and should) guide your posting and strategy decisions.Leverage this information to learn as much as possible about which content has the biggest impact on your community. Evaluate how and why some content works, and some falls short.</p><h2 id=\"\">9. Keep Up with Industry Trends</h2><p>Maintaining a finger on the pulse of trending topics and stories relevant to your target market should always be at the top of your to-do list.Keeping your posts timely is a sure way to improve the organic reach of any post.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Reassess, Revise, and Rework</h2><p>Take the information you cull from your analytics and adjust your strategy. Social media is fluid. This means your strategy must remain agile and flexible.Don't be afraid to change things up!</p><h3 id=\"\">Want to learn more?

      "wp-content": "<p>Are you making these social media mistakes?Here's 12 of the biggest mistakes most businesses make, and how to avoid them!</p><h1 id=\"\">12 Simple Social Media Mistakes (and how to fix them)</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Putting quantity over quality</h2><p>Content matters. Quality matters. Conversation matters. Make quality your focus, not the quantity of content you put out.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Being reactive instead of “active”</h2><p>While it is important to reply to inquiries and thank people for mentions, it is a mistake if it is all that you do.Strive to actively seek out others and create conversation in and around their content. Show that you care by paying attention to where they are and what they are talking about.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Posting without a strategy or plan</h2><p>Posting without a <a href=\"http://12most.com/2013/04/02/social-media-mistakes-we-all-make/%E2%80%9Chttps://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-strategy-cheat-sheet/%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank”\" id=\"\">social media strategy </a>is similar to tossing content at a wall and hoping it sticks. It is a waste of time and will find you throwing away valuable time, resources and money.Take the time to write down your goals, integrate those goals into your overall marketing plan and create daily tasks that move you towards those goals.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Using automated direct messages</h2><p>Whether you manage an active business account or a personal account with the occasional mention, being “on” at all times is a challenge. This makes automating certain tasks very tempting. One of these tasks is thanking new followers.We have all received that auto direct message encouraging us to “find them on Facebook, download their latest e-book or buy their latest product on Amazon.”Not only are these messages spammy, but they also discourage people from interacting with you going forward.<em id=\"\">Bottom line:</em> thank whom you can, as often as you can and do it genuinely.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Posting without proofreading</h2><p>Have you fallen victim to the hastily posted message riddled with misspellings?Blame auto-correct all you want, but it’s your reputation that fails in the end. Take two extra minutes to proof your message before hitting “send” and immortalizing those words online forever.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Posting while tired or inebriated</h2><p>Anytime your thought process is impaired, posting should be avoided.Take a step back and think before you post or better yet — put your computer or mobile device away and avoid a potentially disastrous moment altogether.</p><h2 id=\"\">7. Asking for a RT every time</h2><p>At the beginning of Twitter’s history it was common practice to end a tweet by asking for a retweet.The landscape and usage of Twitter has vastly changed since then and asking for a retweet in every tweet is a mistake. If users find your content interesting, they will retweet it.</p><h2 id=\"\">8. Stretching yourself too thin</h2><p>This one is for anyone who just can’t say no. Whether it’s to the latest and greatest tool or a pet project, taking on too much can leave anyone worn out and weary.As nice as it would be to be everywhere at all times, it is an impossible objective. Streamline your focus and simplify your social media. Take on only what pushes you closer to your goals.</p><h2 id=\"\">9. Spamming your fans and followers</h2><p>Creating conversation and engaging with your fans and followers is what social media is all about.Sending spammy messages that take advantage of the trust placed in you is not. Blasting promotional links will only alienate you and your business from the very consumers you are attempting to reach. Just don’t do it.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Letting fear hold you back</h2><p>Don’t be afraid to take a stand and <a href=\"http://12most.com/2013/04/02/social-media-mistakes-we-all-make/%E2%80%9Chttps://rebekahradice.com/create-active-social-media-community/%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank”\" id=\"\">find your voice on social media</a>. Fear can be debilitating as you over-think what to post, when to post and how it should or should not be said. While you should pay close attention to how your message is received, it’s difficult to create your own unique voice if your posts feel generic and stale.This is not to say that you have to throw caution to the wind, only to say that trying out a new approach or tactic every once in a while won’t hurt. You might be pleasantly surprised how those around you respond.</p><h2 id=\"\">11. Writing a novel with every post</h2><p>We all have verbose friends. You know who they are — the ones with posts that say “click here to read more.” If you happen to be one of those “friends,” know that not every post needs to win a Pulitzer and not every tweet needs to max out the character limit.Sometimes the best posts are short and sweet. Make an extra effort to condense down your thoughts and share in a clear and concise way.</p><h2 id=\"\">12. Diluting the power of #FollowFriday</h2><p>The practice of Follow Friday is a great way to show appreciation to those who have either been following you, or you yourself have been following. The mistake often made is using the #FollowFriday hashtag to randomly tweet out hundreds of names without any apparent connection or forethought whatsoever.Instead, choose to use #FF as a way to showcase specific people that have made an impact on you both personally and professionally. Share their traits and strengths with your followers in a way that encourages others to then follow.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Which simple social media mistake have you made?

You must write and post often and with purpose.Your readers, audience, and community members are looking to you as a resource.

Stay Focused on Your Purpose</h2><p>It's easy to get caught up in “shiny object syndrome.” There's always the newest, latest, and greatest social media strategy.Choose to say no to what isn't tested, and stay focused on what you're building. Work your strategy with diligence.Track progress and iterate based on user behavior and results.</p><p id=\"\">Instead of connecting with a lot of people on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/socialmedia?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">#socialmedia</a>, focus on connecting with the RIGHT people.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Here's how you can do this and how to use social media for your business, even in the midst of a crisis.<a href=\"https://t.co/EKqJdK59j1\" id=\"\">https://t.co/EKqJdK59j1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GArPn50QGq\" id=\"\">pic.twitter.com/GArPn50QGq</a>— Rebekah Radice (@RebekahRadice) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RebekahRadice/status/1250112121020563459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">April 14, 2020</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">6.

Tag, Interact, Get Social</h2><p>Tagging, mentioning, and interacting on social media is the fuel behind your success.Sharing someone else's article, want to highlight someone in your industry? Tag them, mention their name or business, then add context.Give a reason behind what you're sharing and why you found it valuable enough to share.Here's an example of what that looks like:</p><p id=\"\">Top <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Content?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">#Content</a> Marketing Influencers on Twitter:💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeSchiemer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@MikeSchiemer</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/evankirstel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@evankirstel</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbullas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@jeffbullas</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/larrykim?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@larrykim</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenKamauDigital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@BenKamauDigital</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrennerMichael?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@BrennerMichael</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RebekahRadice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@RebekahRadice</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/IsabellajonesCl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@IsabellajonesCl</a>💎<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonathanAufray?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@JonathanAufray</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ContentMarketing?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">#ContentMarketing</a> trends for 2020 in our NEW research ➡️ <a href=\"https://t.co/N7mxYJKcH4\" id=\"\">https://t.co/N7mxYJKcH4</a>.</p><blockquote id=\"\">— SEMrush (@semrush) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/semrush/status/1251258889967976456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">April 17, 2020</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  8.

Cross-Promote</h2><p>Are you posting content to various locations? For example, Instagram is only one spoke in your marketing wheel.Instead of posting to one channel, share content across various social channels. But make sure it's updated for that network.What plays well on LinkedIn doesn't elicit the same response on Facebook. Keep your message on point for the audience you're speaking with.Dr. Beth Frates tweet is a great example.

(source: HubSpot’s <a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/blog/docs/ebooks/the_2012_state_of_inbound_marketing.pdf\" id=\"\">State of Inbound Marketing</a>)That’s a number hard to ignore.If you want to <strong id=\"\">boost your lead conversion rate</strong> through the power of social media, grab the six easy-to-implement tips below!</p><h1 id=\"\">6 Ways to Convert Social Media Leads</h1><h2 id=\"\"> 1. Differentiate Your Personal Brand</h2><p>Want to stand out in a sea of social media noise? Determine <strong id=\"\">what differentiates your personal brand</strong>, sets it apart from the competition and makes it unique. Then clearly articulate each defining trait.For example, you have a client intake form that digs deep into the needs, personality and communication style of your customers.  Consumers eager to connect on a deeper level will resonate with your relationship vs. transactional-based thinking.Use your social networks to express this fact by incorporating it into your conversations, posts and marketing materials. Culture and values should not be overlooked when considering what content to share on social media.It is those traits specific to your culture that draws potential leads towards you as opposed to your competition.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 2. Answer the “What’s In It For Me?” Question</h2><p>Consumers are moving at lightening speed as they research, interact and make purchase decisions online.In order to capture their attention, you need to <strong id=\"\">answer the WIIFM question</strong> immediately.Make sure your posts, tweets and daily interactions are straightforward with a clear call to action. Don’t leave a potential client guessing what you or your product is all about. The benefit should be spelled out and demonstrated in an easy to digest format.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 3. Get Creative</h2><p>Is your social media content limp, lifeless and devoid of any unique qualities that scream YOU?Creativity can be one of the best selling points and when effectively used can contribute to increased leads and conversion. Why would this be?<strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">People want to do business with people they know, like and trust.</em> </strong>Creativity draws from your personality and those traits we discussed above. It defines you, sets you apart and allows people to connect with the juicy goodness that makes you undeniably you!</p><h2 id=\"\"> 4. Respond In a Timely Manner</h2><p>Want to lose a lead? Be slow to respond.If someone has taken the time to reach out to you via social media, you need to take the time to respond in an appropriate time frame.Put systems in place that allow you to easily respond and follow up after their initial contact. <strong id=\"\">Systems create consistency</strong> and consistency builds trust and keeps you top-of-mind.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 5. Educate your Prospects</h2><p>Social media offers business owners and entrepreneurs the ability to keep their message alive.It is is an excellent way to <strong id=\"\">share your knowledge</strong> in an intriguing and conversational manner.Is there a question that you find many of your customers asking over and over again? Turn it into a quick post, new blog article or short video tutorial.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 6. Follow-Up</h2><p>Did a potential client respond to a tweet with a question? Did you answer that question with a link to your website? Do not let that lead drop off your radar.<strong id=\"\">You never want to leave a potential client decision to chance.</strong> Encourage your lead to move forward with further details. Whether it’s a follow-up tweet, a phone call, email or face-to-face meeting, make sure you circle back around.Follow-up is a customer service no-brainer, but an often missed opportunity when it comes to lead conversion.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Tell me!

I have to say it feels good.</p><h4 id=\"\">I love being an entrepreneur!</h4><p id=\"\">There is an amazing sense of empowerment when faced with the day-to-day management of our own future. It’s nothing short of total and complete awesomeness!</p><p id=\"\">So why be an entrepreneur?</p><p id=\"\">Believe it or not, you might already be one and not even know it. Whether you are an author, photographer, speaker or real estate professional, you are an entrepreneur.</p><p id=\"\">But have you totally embraced your dream? If not, I encourage you to take a hard look at the benefits and weigh them against what you are “giving up” (contentment, happiness, time) to stay where you are today.</p><p id=\"\">Maybe, just maybe, it is time to take the leap!</p><h1 id=\"\">Why Being an Entrepreneur ROCKS</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. You Get to Follow Your Passion</h2><p id=\"\">Entrepreneurship presents you with the opportunity to do something you are passionate about. Are you a crafter, blogger or software developer? Turn that passion into profit!</p><p id=\"\">Determine what makes your product, system or tool unique, research your competition, define your differentiating factors, and determine how you can turn that hobby into a lucrative business.</p><p id=\"\">Confucius said...</p><p id=\"\">“Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p><p id=\"\">So true!</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Entrepreneurs Make the Impossible, Possible</h2><p id=\"\">Do names such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates ring a bell to you? They are among the most successful entrepreneurs of our era.</p><p id=\"\">While anyone would love to be in their shoes, the thought of starting and running a business can be scary, but there is a lot to gain. Think about what would be missing from our lives if it weren't for their advances in technology. They truly made the seemingly impossible, possible.</p><p id=\"\">As an entrepreneur, you have the same opportunity. Not only do you have the chance to contribute in a way no other before you thought possible, but you bring a fresh perspective with a new vision and appreciation for the passion you choose to follow.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Independence and Calling the Shots</h2><p id=\"\">Being an entrepreneur means long hours and hard work at the beginning. You are sowing what you wish to reap.</p><p id=\"\">The good news? Commit to taking the required steps to make your business a success and life down the road will become much easier.</p><p id=\"\">There is nothing like calling your own shots. Do the hard work up-front, so you can live life by your rules in the coming years.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Dream Big, Play BIG</h2><p id=\"\">When you close your eyes and dream, what do you see? As an entrepreneur, you control that dream. You have the ability to go as big and bold as you want to each and every day.</p><p id=\"\">Every decision you make and action you take determines how close or far away you get to achieving your dreams. It's up to you to find or create opportunities that will push your forward and enable you to turn your dreams into reality. </p><p id=\"\">Of course the road to entrepreneurial success won't be without its challenges. Believe in your dream, write it down and read it back to yourself every day. Staying focused on why you took this big step will add the fuel to your fire on the days you feel less than enthusiastic about your business.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Freedom to Choose</h2><p id=\"\">“Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.” ― William Jennings Bryan</p><p id=\"\">As an entrepreneur, you have the freedom to choose which path you take. You choose who you will do business with and who you will align with. Do not sell yourself short.</p><p id=\"\">Believing in who you are and the abilities you bring to the table has a miraculous effect on your state-of-mind and business health. Get clear on who you are and then make the choice to put those uniquely wonderful talents to work day in and day out.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. High Income Potential</h2><p id=\"\">Ok, so maybe not immediately, but the opportunity is there.</p><p id=\"\">As an entrepreneur, your income directly relates to the efforts you put into the business, especially when they are well-thought out, planned, and focused. The bottom line? The more effort you put into your business, the greater your rewards will be. </p><p id=\"\">Unlike the job market where your salary is determined by so many factors, as entrepreneur, no one except yourself and market forces can define your income. Of course the market or your industry can be harder on you than your worst boss, but if you pay close attention you can make well-informed decisions accordingly.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. The Excitement of Learning a New Thing Every day</h2><p id=\"\">As an entrepreneur, you will assume numerous roles, some more exciting than others.</p><p id=\"\">You will wear multiple hats and juggle what feels like a ridiculous amount of responsibilities. Take a deep breath and realize that learning these roles and responsibilities is all a part of your entrepreneurial journey.</p><p id=\"\">Look forward to these growth moments; they are truly life changing.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Design a Life You Love</h2><p id=\"\">Your life as an entrepreneur probably won't be glamorous, but it will be yours. Meaning, you control the days and hours you choose to work.</p><p id=\"\">You decide when to meet potential clients, work on projects, watch a soccer game, or spend time with family.</p><p id=\"\">Running your own business offers more flexibility, but it does come with a price. In order to design the life you love, you must be focused, determined, brave and willing to take risks.  </p><h2 id=\"\">  9.

In order to achieve community, one must actually be a part of it. Engaging, socializing, conversing and joining in the discussion.However, while <strong id=\"\">social media can foster awareness</strong>, it cannot elevate you to a thought leader on its own.

Moreover, even though a website functions as the equivalent of yesterday’s brick and mortar business, it does not allow businesses to connect with consumers on an intimate or personal level.Adding a blog to your marketing mix can provide a more in-depth level of communicating/interacting with subscribers, fans and followers. It gives you a portal to disseminate frequent updates on products, services, opinions and events in real-time.For those who are unable to manage a newsletter, blogging is an excellent alternative to engaging readers.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Blog Options and Tools to Get Started:</strong></h3><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">WordPress.org (a self hosted WordPress blog) -</strong>  Self-hosted blogs will require that you purchase a hosting account, install WordPress and either configure and design the site yourself or hire a web designer who can customize on your behalf. This may not be the direction you want to go if you are a first time blogger with little resources.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">WordPress.com -</strong> You can set up a free account at WordPress.com and choose from pre-designed themes.

Repurpose what you already have.I joined Kelly Mitchell, Founder/Producer of <a href=\"http://www.agentcaffeine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Agent Caffeine</a>, on her live weekly broadcast to share quick ways to breathe new life into your old content.The topic was based on my article, ”<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/revive-old-blog-content/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">How to Instantly Revive Old Blog Content</a>,” and spawned an enthusiastic discussion.Each strategy shared is designed to help you repurpose old content and build new buzz around it.Below you will find five creative ways to dust off old content!</p><h2 id=\"\"> 1. Repurpose into a New Format</h2><p>Not everyone chooses to consume information in the same way.While one person might enjoy reading, another might look to Facebook. Don't miss the opportunity to put a new spin on old content.Take an old blog post and turn it into a podcast, presentation or even a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/video-interviews-to-boost-business-visibility/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">short video</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Create Short List Posts</h2><p>Drill down into an old post by taking one point and expanding upon it.For example, you wrote an article on using <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/twitter-tips-to-virtually-dominate-your-niche/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Twitter</a> to expand your online presence. One of your points was Twitter tools.Take that point and use a tool like <a href=\"http://list.ly\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Listly</a> to bullet point each unique Twitter tool that business marketers could use to expand their social presence.</p><blockquote id=\"\">How to use List.ly to blow up your blog traffic <a href=\"http://t.co/GkJhkbCiGj\" id=\"\">http://t.co/GkJhkbCiGj</a>— Mike Allton (@mike_allton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_allton/statuses/395905602834432000\" id=\"\">October 31, 2013</a></blockquote><p>Then embed that list into your blog, linking back to your Listly account. The list above received over 2000 views. Not a bad way to get your content in front of a whole new audience, right?</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Use Twitter to Grab the Attention of a New Audience</h2><p>Using <strong id=\"\">Twitter as a research and support tool</strong> is a terrific way to filter back through old blog content.</p><blockquote id=\"\">25 Smart Ways to Promote Your Latest Blog Post <a href=\"http://t.co/Rd5OFQlJKl\" id=\"\">http://t.co/Rd5OFQlJKl</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blogging&src=hash\" id=\"\">#blogging</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23marketing&src=hash\" id=\"\">#marketing</a>— Rebekah Radice (@RebekahRadice) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RebekahRadice/statuses/394159030756999168\" id=\"\">October 26, 2013</a></blockquote><p>Take a blog post and A/B test your titles. Change up the context, add your thoughts and share why your followers should read it.And don’t just share once. Use a tool like<a href=\"https://followerwonk.com\" id=\"\"> Followerwonk</a> to identify when your followers are online.Now <strong id=\"\">tweet it out multiple times per day</strong> to determine what content resonates with your audience.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Write a Follow-Up Post</h2><p>Have you written an evergreen article that needs some updating?Write a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/revive-old-blog-content/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">follow-up post</a> with the new details and an explanation of how those changes impact your readers.Stop the churn and burn. There is so much great content sitting on your blog.There's no reason to reinvent the wheel when you can update an old article in 30 minutes or less.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Leverage Google Plus</h2><p>Lets face it. If you're a content creator, the <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-google-plus-to-generate-massive-exposure/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social network</a> created by the worlds largest search engine can not  be overlooked.Do not miss the opportunity to <strong id=\"\">capitalize on this vibrant and interactive community</strong>.Did you write a Q and A post five years ago that is still relevant to your clientele today?Update the information and link back to your original post. This shows that you are actively staying on top of changes within your industry but also continues to position you as the expert within your field.And guess what? This is an article I just updated and reshared. It's really that simple to put a whole new face on old blog content!</p><h4 id=\"\">How are you repurposing your old blog content?

(part one of our two-part series)Each one is ready for you to swipe and adopt into your business immediately!</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Create Social Media Magic</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Optimize Your Social Media Bio's</h2><p>Ready to connect and engage with the right people? Then complete your social media profiles, including an optimized and keyword-rich profile.Make certain that who you are, what you do, and how you can assist potential clients are prominent within your bio.You also want to make it easy for anyone to connect with you. Include your links to your website and other social profiles.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Join Google Plus and Get Active</h2><p>Want to get found? Then get on Google Plus! There is a direct correlation between Google Plus engagement and your search results. This means that it isn't enough to simply join the social network. You must get involved.Begin by seeking out business professionals within your industry and adding them to circles. Circles are similar to Facebook or Twitter lists. They will allow you to keep up with a select group of individuals based on the circle (think category) you have placed them in.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Join Google Plus Communities</h2><p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/communities/101709091817958049388?utm_source=chrome_ntp_icon&utm_medium=chrome_app&utm_campaign=chrome\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google Plus communities</a> are another great way to make valuable connections and share your content with a group eager to consume it. Check out the \"communities\" tab and search based on keywords for communities you would find interesting. Then begin to +1, comment, and share other members' content.The best rule of thumb in any community is to get involved, create a conversation and interact consistently before you start marketing or pushing your agenda. Allow people to get to know and appreciate you first.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Connect via Google Plus Hangouts</h2><p>Google Plus hangouts are an excellent way to get face-to-face with those individuals you have connected with and are eager to learn more about. Similar to Skype or Facetime, hangouts are easy to use and simple to access via your Google Plus account.Take the time to reach out and go deeper with those within your industry. I guarantee it will be time well spent!</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Use Twitter Lists</h2><p>A quick way to join the conversation and stay connected with a specific group is to add them to a list. Use Twitter lists to group together people you want to engage with daily. Then add this list to your favorite third-party management tool and review it daily.You will see a quick snapshot of what each person on that list is talking about. Rather than trying to track each one down, make it easy to stay on top of what is being said. Then comment or retweet their content to begin building relationships.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Pin Custom Images to Pinterest</h2><p>Creating a custom graphic for your original content and pinning it to Pinterest is an excellent way to get your business in front of a whole new audience.Pin your image, share it to Twitter and then use that same image on Google Plus. Want to learn more?

Use LinkedIn to Connect with Industry Experts</h2><p>You spend time on Facebook, but have you made your mark on the social network built for business professionals?Use LinkedIn to establish rapport with experts within your industry. Make sure to send a custom message including who you are and why you are interested in connecting. Grab this <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/linkedin-group-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">great tip</a> from Viveka Von Rosen, Founder of Linked to Business, on how to pump up your LinkedIn marketing efforts!</p><h2 id=\"\">7. Join LinkedIn Groups</h2><p>There are many LinkedIn groups to choose from, so it is important to be picky when identifying where to spend your time.Do a quick search based on keyword or industry and determine which group might be a good source of leads, referrals, or recruits. Then get into the conversation!</p><h2 id=\"\">8. Start (or Join) a Facebook Group</h2><p>If your niche is hot, invite past clients, prospects, and other industry professionals to join your Facebook Group.Explain the benefits and why the group was created. Set expectations and ensure everyone joining the group is a safe space, free from any hard sales tactics. You want to be a resource, not an annoying marketer with only your best intentions in mind.</p><h2 id=\"\">9. Promote via Instagram</h2><p>Use Instagram to support all of your marketing efforts.Have a blog? Post an image with a call-to-action directing followers to your website, share a quote or tip from your post, or simply notify followers that you have a new post up and direct them to your blog.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221b2b8b8c2a1c474138_promote-blog-post.jpeg\" alt=\"blog post promotion\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">10. Talk to Your Niche</h2><p>Stumped when it comes to content creation? Ask people within your niche!Creating meaningful relationships with other influencers and actively creating an online presence is a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of what's hot within your niche or industry.</p><h2 id=\"\">11. Stumbleupon</h2><p>Though not as popular as it was before, <a href=\"http://stumbleupon.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Stumbleupon</a> can still drive a lot of traffic to a website or blog. See one of my posts below; a good reminder to Stumble all of your new content.Likewise, it is also a great way to find fresh content within your niche. Check out their categories and find timely and relevant content for your audience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d8fbcbe7265c062aa_stumbleupon.jpeg\" alt=\"stumbleupon\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">12. Keep a Virtual Notebook of Ideas</h2><p>I might love technology, but I'm an old-school girl in many ways. A notebook is one of them.Keep a notepad handy to quickly jot down ideas that can be turned into social media posts down the road. Want to take it one step further? Expand upon your notes and turn that single idea into a short blog post, video tip, or list on <a href=\"http://listly.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Listly.</a></p><h2 id=\"\">13. Comment on Blogs</h2><p>Commenting on blogs is a strategy used by many active bloggers to gain visibility, boost awareness and create strategic relationships.

      "wp-content": "<p>If you spend any time on <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-captivating-social-media-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a>, you are familiar with the phrase content marketing.However, while you might be familiar with it, you may have tossed the idea aside, believing it to be a complicated strategy reserved for the “gurus, masters, and mavens” of social media.The good news? It's not as complex as it might seem.</p><h1 id=\"\">4 Steps to Content Marketing Success</h1><p>Before diving in, let's take a quick look at content marketing.There's a lot of confusion regarding terminology like social media, digital marketing, visual marketing, etc.Knowing the role of content marketing in all of that simplifies the process.</p><h2 id=\"\">What is Content Marketing?</h2><p>Content marketing is, in its purest form, connection marketing. It offers the right content to the right people with the right frequency and consistency.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tweet This! <a href=\"http://clicktotweet.com/HIZcS\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Content marketing is what drives sales, boosts your bottom line, and connects consumers to your brand.</a></h5><p>Whether you are the manager of your own personal social media content, or the leader of a company or brand social media marketing team, finding the right balance, rhythm, and flow for your content is crucial.So how can you find perfect content that resonates with your audience?</p><h2 id=\"\">  1. Do Your Research</h2><p>Telling a story before you know your audience is a mistake I see many marketers make. Rather than mapping a destination and setting the course, content is pushed out in haste with little understanding of the wants or needs of the audience.Just like any other marketing endeavor, a documented and well-supported plan is vital to sustained success. Simply put, taking the time on the front end to research the where what, and why of your potential clients will pay off tenfold down the road.</p><h3 id=\"\">Research will allow you to avoid these questions:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Why is no one listening?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Why am I not receiving any retweets, shares, or comments?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What’s wrong with my content?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do people even care about my brand?</li></ul><p>Instead of constantly reinventing your strategy only because one does not exist, make a conscious effort to focus on the consumer and strive to connect by offering intentional, deliberate, and strategic content that resonates rather than repels.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Understand Internet Media</h2><p>There are three types of media on the Internet: Paid, Owned and Earned.Paid is just what it sounds like, getting your product out there through established internet members. For Example, Google AdSense, Facebook sponsored posts, and Twitter sponsored hashtags.Owned is the practice of leveraging all of the tools you already have on your hands, such as Facebook, WordPress, and YouTube, to gain better notoriety.Earned media is then the culmination of the first two media types. Earned media is the mentions you gain from the time and effort you have put into the brand that set you apart from everyone else.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Find the right content marketing channel</h2><p>I find that I tend to follow a company or brand on only one social media outlet, whether that is Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. While I may follow company A on Facebook, Company B on Google+, and Company C on Instagram, I will rarely follow any of those companies on more than one. Typically it is the social media outlet where I first found them.Fans will follow a similar pattern. The key is to determine which social network they prefer. It may be a difficult process at first, but discovering where your audience spends their time can be a huge breakthrough in your content marketing.Instead of beating your head against a wall trying just to get five +1’s on Google+, you can take that time to focus on your 100,000 followers on Twitter.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4.  Create share-worthy content</h2><p>The final and most important key is to create content that others will find “share-worthy.” Getting likes and comments on Facebook may feel great, but it cannot compare to the power of a share.Once one person shares your post, a whole new audience is opened up that you otherwise never would have reached. In essence, you have just received free marketing.Not every one of your posts will be gold, but if you take the time to research your audience, understand how to promote your post across multiple social channels, and discover the right way to ultimately deliver the content, you will find that success becomes a consistent part of your marketing strategy.</p><h5 id=\"\">What struggles do you have with content marketing?</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">I don't know what kind of content to produce.</li> \t<li id=\"\">I don't know what my customers like.</li> \t<li id=\"\">I don't know how to research my audience.</li> \t<li id=\"\">I don't know how to promote my content.</li> \t<li id=\"\">I don't know how to re-use my content.</li></ul><p>I'd love to hear your answers in the comments below!</p>",

Repurpose your content by putting a new face on it!Below are eight ways you can <strong id=\"\">take your existing content and repurpose it</strong> for a whole new audience!</p><h1 id=\"\">8 Ways to Revive Old Blog Content</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Follow-Up Post</h2><p>Have you been blogging for some time? Then you've probably built up a considerable amount of content.If you struggle to continuously come up with fresh topics for your website, using old posts as inspiration can be very helpful.Go back through past posts in your Google Analytics and scan for those that performed well. Now look to see if there was any one article that felt unfinished or would possibly warrant additional information due to changes or updates.Writing a follow-up post is a great way to breathe new life into your old post by linking back to it as a reference. And don’t forget the added bonus of additional traffic when you revive a hot topic.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Roundup of Resources</h2><p>Weekly or monthly roundup posts are a very popular way to highlight articles that deserve a second look. Cultivate a list of your previous articles and include them amidst other relevant blogs within your niche.Be picky in which articles you choose, linking back to only a select group of your top posts. This will ensure value to your readers, rather than simply feeling like a ploy to gather additional views and shares.Look to someone like Carol Lynn Rivera who puts together an excellent <a href=\"http://www.websearchsocial.com/top-marketing-blogs-password-cracking-pinwoot-for-pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">weekly roundup</a> of posts. Notice how she adds context around each article, sharing her take on why the post is roundup worthy.This is the value in the post. Simply throwing up a bunch of links is not of any value to your readers.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d2715738d4b996426_resource-roundup-post.jpeg\" alt=\"resource roundup post\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Design a Graphic for Pinterest</h2><p>Why repurpose content specifically for Pinterest? First and foremost, Pinterest offers a way to visually brand your business, putting your message in front of a whole new audience.And it’s an audience eager to buy according to recent studies. In fact, Pinterest has proven to generate over 400% more revenue per click than Twitter and 27% more than Facebook.Five tips for finding success on Pinterest according to Cynthia Sanchez, Owner <a href=\"http://www.ohsopinteresting.com/5-tips-for-finding-success-on-pinterest-osp-episode-032/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Oh So Pinteresting</a> is:</p><ol id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Create a plan</li>\t<li id=\"\">Take a good look at your site</li>\t<li id=\"\">Put in the time</li>\t<li id=\"\">Leverage what you already have</li>\t<li id=\"\">Patience</li></ol><p>Ready to create a graphic, but don't consider yourself a Photoshop aficionado? Use <a href=\"http://canva.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Canva</a>, a free photo-editing tool to create an eye-catching visual.As one of the best visual content creation tools available online today, Canva offers great effects that can quickly and easily put a little WOW into your images.</p><h5 id=\"\">Stock image versus a Custom Design:</h5><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d27157314ed996425_perfect-pinterest-image.jpeg\" alt=\"create perfect pinterest image\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Share that Graphic to Google Plus</h2><p>Now that you've created the perfect image for Pinterest, share it to Google Plus. The image, plus detailed context from your blog post make a striking share that instantly breathes new life into your post and provides an incredible conversation starter on your Google Plus profile.According to Peg Fitzpatrick, <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/07/22/how-google-and-pinterest-are-like-peanut-butter-and-jelly/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google+ and Pinterest are the perfect match</a>!</p><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“Beautiful images propel content on Pinterest and Google. Use all the real estate that you can on each image by creating a big, vertical image. Add some text and watermark it to boost your branding.”</em></blockquote><p>Peg recommends image dimensions of 600 x 900 for both social platforms and I can attest to the value behind this formula. Since changing the size, look, feel and strategy behind my Google Plus posts, my engagement has increased by a whopping 67%!</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Create an Audio, Video or Podcast Recording</h2><p>Did you write a list post that performed well its first time around? Take each bullet point and turn it into a quick audio or video post. Answer a reader frequently asked question or simply highlight a feature within your business.If you have contemplated stepping into podcasting, but weren’t sure what to talk about, grab a few points from your article and expand upon each bullet point.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Email Mini-Course</h2><p>Take a series of related articles and turn them into an email course. Add 5-7 emails to a drip campaign.You can also break down one article into multiple tip emails. For example, you share home décor tips via your blog. A frequently asked question by your clients is how to mix traditional and modern elements into their home. Helpful how-to emails are a great way to revive an old post and attract new subscribers to your blog.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Webinar Script and Slide Deck</h2><p>Use your article as the basis for a webinar, presentation or workshop. If you’re a speaker, repurposing blog content can cut your preparation time dramatically.<a href=\"http://www.haikudeck.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Haiku Deck</a> is a fabulous app that easily allows you to convert an article into a visually appealing slide deck. Incredibly intuitive, Haiku Deck will save you an incredible amount of time and allow you to create stunning, image-rich slideshows that stand out.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d271573366a996424_haiku-deck.jpeg\" alt=\"haiku deck\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  8. Social Media Posts</h2><p>While Google Plus and Pinterest are excellent resources for visual content, do not neglect other social networks such Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.Each one is a great tool to repurpose and share your content. And if you are worried about filtering through old content, remember that  just because the blog is old to you doesn't mean  readers won't find it interesting.Use the tool “<a href=\"http://www.savepublishing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Save Publishing</a>” to grab snippets or quotes from your post to break up your article into bite-sized tweets. Use a tool like Hootsuite to schedule these tweets throughout the month. And make sure to change up the type of tweet.For example, tweet a quote linking back to Pinterest or Google+ to cross-promote your content. You can also use the Wordpress plugin <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/evergreen-post-tweeter/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Evergreen Post Tweeter </a>to schedule and tweet old posts on a continuous basis.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">How are you repurposing your content?

      "wp-content": "<p id=\"\">Pinterest may be the current social media belle of the visual marketers ball, but that doesn't mean everyone truly gets it yet.While <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/pinterest-isnt-a-social-network-thats-what-makes-it-great.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pinterest is an exciting opportunity for business</a> marketers, capitalizing on this unique platform can feel elusive.If you are interested in marketing your products or services, the goal behind Pinterest is simple:Create brand awareness by providing eye-catching images that drive traffic to your website, increase sales, revenue and cash flow.</p><h5 id=\"\">Sounds easy, right?</h5><p id=\"\">Not for most businesses still struggling to piece together a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-to-virtually-crush-the-competition/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">successful social media marketing</a> plan.So how can you begin to integrate Pinterest into your overall marketing strategy?Here are a few Pinterest tips and tricks to help you make the most out of this visual marketing tool.</p><h1 id=\"\">Pinterest Tips and Tricks</h1><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;1. Learn the Language</h2><p id=\"\">As with any social media site, there is a language unique to the network.Learning the lingo before you get started will help you quickly adjust to this new environment.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Board – think of boards as content buckets of similar content. You can capture content and add it to these boards where they become easily shareable.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pin – a pin is an image that you have captured and added to a board.</li> \t<li id=\"\">RePin – the act of sharing someone’s pin to one of your boards.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Comments and Likes – similar to Facebook, Pinterest allows you to like someone’s pin or leave a comment on the pin.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pin it button – this can be added to your browser allowing you to easily pin anything you want to share.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;2. Share Interesting Content</h2><p id=\"\">This may feel like a “well, duh” kind of moment, but you would be surprised at how uninteresting some of the Pinterest boards I see truly are.Make sure the content you share is always exciting, interesting and appealing to your followers. When you are pinning images, presentation really does matter.Take a look at this <a href=\"https://pin.it/3H8JesB\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">beautiful cheesecake</a> from the <a href=\"http://mymothersapronstrings.blogspot.com/2010/03/sono-cheesecake.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">SoNo Baking Company</a>. </p><p id=\"\">Based on presentation alone, I not only want to buy it, but I want to run out and do it right now.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221df47c95636f3e04da_project-foodie.jpeg\" alt=\"rasberry cheesecake\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">While sharing interesting content is incredibly important, so is consistency.If you are going to commit to marketing your business on Pinterest, it will not happen overnight. This means you cannot simply throw up a few images and scurry away. You can only continue to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/5-powerful-pinterest-tools-to-grow-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">generate interest and intrigue</a> by adding fresh content to your boards on a consistent basis.</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;3. Be Relevant</h2><p id=\"\">Post content that your followers will be interested in sharing. Who is your target audience and what are they looking for?While it is fun to pin your interests, hobbies and activities outside of work, make sure you share content from your site and others that speaks to the needs of your potential customers.</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;4. Optimize Your Profile</h2><p id=\"\">Complete your profile on Pinterest and optimize it for search. Add keywords that best define and describe your business.Remember, people connect with human beings, not automated robots. Make sure you use keywords, but also add those things that make you unique. What do you enjoy outside of the office and what are those “coffee table” type details that will generate conversation? Add those to your bio as well.</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;5. Promote your Pinterest Page</h2><p id=\"\">A few ways to bring added exposure to your pins:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Connect your Twitter and Facebook accounts to Pinterest.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share your Pinterest posts on Facebook, including a link back to the pin.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Join Facebook groups or other online groups where members share tips and tricks that can &nbsp;help you promote business. An excellent group (and chat) to join is Kelly Lieberman’s <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/kellylieberman/pinchat/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">#Pinchat</a>.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Publish your Pinterest posts on Twitter.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Add the “Follow me on Pinterest” button to your website and <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-pinterest-pin-it-button-in-your-wordpress-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blog</a>.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Promote your social site to your email list or add an announcement to your weekly/monthly newsletter.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;6. Share Quality Images</h2><p id=\"\">Pinterest is a visual marketing medium; therefore, the success of your content will rely heavily on the quality of your images. So, take really good pictures or create images that cause people to take action.Make sure you have professional looking images taken against a clean background and photographed with style. Use a photo editing software such as <a href=\"http://picmonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">PicMonkey</a> to edit the images and add flair to an otherwise boring picture. Pictures are your currency!</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;7. Follow Similar Pinners</h2><p id=\"\">Follower pinners with similar content, pin posts by bloggers you follow and then like and comment on their content. When you are active in the Pinterest community, other users get to know you and will follow you, repin your pins and help you gain more visibility.As with all social sites, sharing is based on the law of reciprocity. This means that you give and take mutually; sharing others content which in return will hopefully open the door to mutual sharing of content. Besides the business benefits, sharing others content just creates good social karma so make it a must-do in your marketing strategy.</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;8. Pay Attention to Your Analytics</h2><p id=\"\">The ability to reach a large audience isn’t the only plus when it comes to Pinterest marketing. You also have available to you an analytics tool that allows you to see how much traffic you are directing to your website plus which pins are receiving the most attention.There are a few steps involved before you can access Pinterest analytics. Read the <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/pinterest-analytics-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">step-by-step instructions</a>.</p><p id=\"\">Those are a few of my top Pinterest tips and tricks to help you promote your business.

These six tips will help you get started.</p><h1 id=\"\">Leverage Blogging to Build Business Identity, Authority and Credibility</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Post with Purpose</h2><p>Your first step towards creating a blog worth visiting is posting fresh and unique content. If you are eager to gain loyal blog subscribers, and what blogger isn’t, then you must provide a solid enough reason to keep them coming back for more.Before you haphazardly begin creating content, sit down and ask yourself a few questions.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Who is your target audience?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What type of content are they looking for?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What need are you able to fill or what problems can you solve through your blog?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your purpose? e.g. exposure, income, thought leadership.</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your time commitment?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do you envision blogging long-term?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your budget</li></ul><p>Your blog can generate interest and produce results if you know what the purpose is before you begin.

Post Consistently</h2><p>Posting consistently lends credibility to your blog.  Plan on writing two content rich posts per week.  These do not need to be long, but they do need to be frequent. Pick the days and times you will post to keep you focused on a deadline and your readers accustomed to looking for your content.However, I do want to qualify my above recommendation. If your answer to the time commitment question precludes you from posting twice per week, this is not a deal killer.Always remember, put quality above quantity. If you can only post once per week, but it is quality work, your readers will appreciate it and you will benefit from their ongoing loyalty.Once you begin to post consistently, make sure you share it consistently across your social media networks.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tool Tip: Use Buffer to Post Consistently to Social Networks</h5><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d2b8b8c0d0c474146_blog-post-tool.jpeg\" alt=\"buffer blog post tool\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Provide Valuable Information</h2><p>Understand your niche or target market and offer specifics around that topic. Take frequently asked questions and answer them with a detailed response that anyone would find valuable. Provide tips, offer items of value, or share details about issues surrounding your industry.Share your knowledge and expertise by giving readers and subscribers the content they really want. Make your blog a destination and one they cannot live without.</p><h5 id=\"\">A word of caution: Building trust will not happen overnight.</h5><p>It will take a commitment to consistency and a willingness to give freely of your insight, wisdom and knowledge without anticipating anything in return. This gives readers the opportunity to see that you are in it for them, not just the paycheck.In order to stay relevant, you need to factor in time spent researching your consumer. What are they talking about, what are they worried about and what are they unhappy about when they discuss your industry or even your competitors.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tool Tip: Research Your Consumer Needs</h5><p>Use a site like Addictomatic to see what others are talking about within your niche or industry. Educate yourself on what is happening in real-time across the web and then take that knowledge and translate it into content for your target market.<a href=\"http://addictomatic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Addictomatic</a> searches multiple sites at once looking for the top mentions, retweets and blog posts being shared around your specified keyword. Add your search topic. run a search of YouTube, Bing, Flickr, Delicious and more. Then rinse and repeat!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d2b8b8c84ff474144_addictomatic.jpeg\" alt=\"addictomatic social media tool\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Speak Directly to Your Target Market</h2><p>Show your readers how much you care by researching who they are and what it is that matters most to them. Do not assume that just because you have been in your industry for a substantial amount of time that you automatically know what they are looking for.  Times change and industries evolve, so make sure to stay on top of yours.Ask questions, listen to the answers and study your analytics.  It is very easy to see through Google Analytics where your readers came from, what keywords they used to end up on your page and how long they stuck around.This is precisely why it is vital to know what your goal is before you begin to blog and then speak directly to the needs of your readers, adjusting that message as necessary to encourage readership growth.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tool Tip: Know Your Niche</h5><p><a href=\"http://socialmention.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Mention</a> is a nifty tool with a ton of functionality. Dissect, analyze and research content based on keyword, phrase or Twitter handle.Begin by taking a look at your industry specific keywords and then drill down into the blogs, tweets and posts that pull up in the stream of most recent content shared.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d2b8b8c6370474148_social-mention.jpeg\" alt=\"social mention monitoring tool\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Love What You Do and Let It Show</h2><p>If you love what you do then it should be reflected in everything you say and write.  Be excited about what you have to offer and why working with you would be a benefit.Consumers sense desperation so always remember to keep your posts upbeat, positive and informative without getting bogged down by dreary details.Is your industry going through hard times, has your business hit a slow patch or are you angry with a competitor? Nix the desire to share every last detail and instead choose to be a beacon of positivity. As the saying goes, \"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\"</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Join in the Conversation</h2><p>The single most effective way to build loyalty and trust is through conversation.  A blog allows readers to get to know you on a very intimate level.  If you let comments sit without responding or even acknowledging them, you are giving away a valuable opportunity.You not only have the chance to answer their question in a public forum but you allow your readers to see that you care about their needs and are there to assist when they are ready.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tool Tip: Use a Third-Party Management Tool</h5><p>To stay consistently in the conversation, consider using a tool like <a href=\"http://hootsuite.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hootsuite</a> to schedule your content. You can choose a specific time to post to various social networks or choose specific times with Hootsuite's auto-schedule feature and then post at custom times throughout the day.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d2b8b8cd81a474147_hootsuite.jpeg\" alt=\"hootsuite social management tool\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h4 id=\"\"> <em id=\"\">How are you using your blog to build business buzz?

If you're an entrepreneur struggling to <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/set-achievable-social-media-goals-for-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">reach goals</a>, push past limits, and accomplish anything you set your mind to, this may be the one thing standing in your way.While self-sabotage can take on various forms, one constant is fear. And as a driving emotion behind self-sabotage, fear can be a very powerful motivator.Whether it's the fear of learning something new, taking on \"one more thing,\" or the dreaded imposter syndrome, the result is always the same.If you allow fear to take root, it will fester, tearing down your self-esteem and confidence.If you're ready to <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/one-thing-holding-every-entrepreneur-back-from-success/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">stop sabotaging success</a>, here are 4 ways to find your focus, face your fears, and embrace opportunities.</p><h1 id=\"\">4 TED Talks to Help Any Entrepreneur Stop Sabotaging Success</h1><p>What is fear costing you? According to a study on <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275103124_Fear_and_Entrepreneurship_A_Review_and_Research_Agenda\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Fear and Entrepreneurship</a>, it's costing you more than you might think.Fear, if left unchecked, becomes a major psychological barrier. It inhibits risk-taking, decision-making, and problem-solving, keeping you in a constant internal \"tug-of-war.\"It's a state that cements you in inactivity, stealing away opportunity and keeping you from truly embracing the possibility in and around your business. So, where do you begin to overcome its clutches when it takes hold?Right here...</p><h2 id=\"\">  1. Diagnose Your Fear</h2><p>If you find yourself in the self-sabotage boat, you're not alone. Fear is a very real emotion that either pushes you forward or holds you back in business and life.The bad news is that fear, if allowed to grow, will only strangle and eventually squelch your efforts altogether.So as an <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/the-one-secret-every-successful-entrepreneur-knows/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">entrepreneur</a>, how can you avoid the ugly consequence of debilitating fear? You first need to know what you're dealing with.</p><h3 id=\"\">Do you fear:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">The unknown?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Making a mistake?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Losing money or time?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Making the wrong decision?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Letting others down?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Losing out to your competition?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Embarrassment?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Hard work and no payoff?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Learning something new?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Being rejected?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Losing someone's respect if you fail?</li></ul><p>In this TED talk, Luvvie Ajayi shares 3 questions to ask yourself when facing fear, encouraging everyone to get a little more comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/luvvie_ajayi_get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Embrace the Fear</h2><p>As an entrepreneur interested in building a successful business and <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/build-powerful-personal-brand-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">strong personal brand</a>, taking risks can be downright scary.There's no doubt that making a bold or \"unpopular\" decision, as Erika Napoletano calls it in her TEDx talk, is not for the weak of heart. It takes resolve and a desire to stop wasting time (and brain cells) on someone else's version of your success.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S4DOJpB2I8o?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div><figcaption>﻿</figcaption></figure><p>Now, as you sit back and worry about the next big decision in your business, consider this. Only those who never take a risk avoid failure. Let that sink in.<em id=\"\">Only those who never risk a thing ever avoid failing at anything.</em>Do you want to be the person sitting on the sidelines, idly watching as opportunity passes you by? Or would you rather be the person taking control, making decisions, and entrenching yourself in the belief that you can and will succeed at anything you put your mind to?I'm guessing that decision is a no-brainer. 😉</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Stop Focusing on Fear</h2><p>If you're familiar with the phrase, \"thoughts determine actions,\" then you know the power these two have to shape and mold your future. But it's not just your thoughts and actions, but your lack thereof.If you could stop focusing on your fear today, what would you accomplish right now?</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Give a speech</li> \t<li id=\"\">Launch a new product</li> \t<li id=\"\">Write a book</li> \t<li id=\"\">Double your team</li> \t<li id=\"\">Start a new company</li></ul><p>Tim Ferris shares in his TED talk that \"the hard choices -- what we most fear doing, asking, saying -- are very often exactly what we need to do.\"In his talk, Tim encourages you to fully envision and write down your fears in detail, in a simple but powerful exercise he calls \"fear-setting.\"</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><p>So what would yours be? Because sure, you could live a safe, comfortable, albeit fearful life.But I'm betting you'd prefer to be bold in your thoughts and actions. To begin, identify what's holding you back, then put a plan in place to tackle it, and from there take steps towards it every single day.The flip side of that is complacency; sadly, it's easier to accept than you think.Make a commitment to kick fear and apathy (its partner in crime) to the curb.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Change Your Words</h2><p>If you want to overcome your fears, change up your words. Stop focusing on the negative (I can't) and instead focus on the positive ( I will).In an experiment by <a href=\"https://goop.com/wellness/mindfulness/the-scary-power-of-negative-words/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Japanese scientist, Masaru Emoto</a>, it was found that words have the power and the energy to create change.<em id=\"\">\"When frozen, water that’s free from all impurities will form beautiful ice crystals that look exactly like snowflakes under a microscope. Water that’s polluted, or has additives like fluoride, will freeze without forming crystals.In his experiments, Emoto poured pure water into vials labeled with negative phrases like “I hate you” or “fear.” After 24 hours, the water was frozen and no longer crystallized under the microscope: It yielded gray, misshapen clumps instead of beautiful lace-like crystals.In contrast, Emoto placed labels that said things like “I Love You” or “Peace” on vials of polluted water, and after 24 hours, they produced gleaming, perfectly hexagonal crystals. Emoto’s experiments proved that energy generated by positive or negative words can actually change the physical structure of an object.\"</em>Once you change your words and recognize their positive value, doors of opportunity will begin to open. Sound crazy or too simplistic? Listen in as Karen Thompson Walker shares what fear can teach us.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/karen_thompson_walker_what_fear_can_teach_us\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h2><p>Fear can be debilitating. It can also sap you of the positive energy that your business needs to move forward.I challenge you to start fresh. Wipe the slate clean and make one small decision that will propel you forward.It's easy to shout the entrepreneurial mantra, \"go big or go home,\" but sometimes the small steps are the biggest of all.They allow us to name the fear, plan the attack, and commit to finally overcoming the self-sabotage.</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Are you looking to use Facebook as a marketing tool, but know your current content is dull, lifeless, and desperately needs a makeover?If you are ready to turn up the volume on your business and gain the edge over your competition, you must understand how to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/spice-up-social-media-content/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create compelling and actionable content</a>.Content that inspires interaction, boosts engagement and facilitates conversation.So how can you get started?The following tips will help you build your business and turn up the volume on your personal brand!</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Use Facebook Marketing in Your Business</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Create a Memorable Brand</h2><p>Your business has an amazing opportunity to translate an established offline reputation to online currency. Unfortunately, what I see all too often is a complete lack of understanding on how to transition an offline “look and feel” to a memorable online brand.Imagine the unbelievable power of a group of people that not only love your business, but eagerly share everything they love about it with friends, family and others within their sphere? That is the power available to you when you use Facebook to properly position and promote your business.</p><h5 id=\"\">The keys to creating a memorable brand are simple:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Share your business story in a real and authentic way, allowing  prospective clients an intimate look in to who you are and why they would want to work with you.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create content that caters to your fans particular by crafting content that speaks to their wants, needs and desires.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Discuss what matters most to anyone in need of your product or service. Avoid ever using Facebook to discuss immaterial, vapid or otherwise irrelevant topics.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  2. Keep it Current and Consistent</h2><p>While content might be the reigning King of a powerful online presence, consistency is Queen. Creating quality content without a posting strategy is nothing more than a hope and a dream. The hope is that eventually someone will find you, even though your posting is at best erratic and sporadic. To that I say, keep on dreaming.Here’s why you need to end that cycle today.The only way to build relationships and earn the trust of consumers is to show up on a consistent basis. This means that you not only must post interesting and relevant content, but engage in the conversation.</p><h5 id=\"\">A few tips to stay current and consistent:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Schedule time in to your calendar each day to interact with fans and other pages. Social media is not a one-way street. Participation is the key to a successful strategy.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Make a list of your content, both online and offline. Determine what you can share and how you might be able to repurpose that content. For instance, take your latest newsletter and turn your top tips into a shareable graphic.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use an RSS reader such as Feedly to curate content. This will make it quick and easy to find and share quality and timely information with your fans.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  3. Mix it Up</h2><p>Great Facebook conversations begin with great content. Don’t get stuck in a rut.Many businesses make the mistake of simply blasting their marketing message instead of using Facebook as a platform to create energetic and evocative discussions. As the saying goes, variety is the spice of life, and the same holds true for content.Keep fans engaged with playful, but highly entertaining facts, personal commentary, statistics and topical news around your business or niche.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Ask Questions</h2><p>Facebook is an excellent platform to crowdsource questions vital to your business.Launching a new product or preparing to roll out a new logo? Ask your fans what they think by offering them a special sneak peek.Everyone enjoys being an insider when it comes to revealing news and as you can see from the <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/more-likes-on-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">KISSMetrics findings</a> below, questions can boost engagement exponentially!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221c6c28f44b1de40b62_facebook-questions-boost-engagement.jpeg\" alt=\"kissmetrics facebook questions findings\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Have a Clear Call to Action</h2><p>There is no sense in posting if you have yet to figure out what your end goal is. Whether you are simply looking to gain shares on a post or you are actively promoting a new product and directing your fans to a landing page, never leave your desired result to chance.Be specific and tell your fans what specific action you want them to take. Do this by including something as simple as “SHARE” if you agree or “click the link to see more.”While there are many different ways you can tweak your posts to make them stand out, the end result should always be the same. Your fans should take action in one way, shape or form.Not including a call to action can be the difference between a post that never reaches the newsfeed or a post that receives an enormous amount of engagement and extended reach.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Use Images to Connect</h2><p>Use images and graphics to connect fans to your brand. Whether it is a picture of your latest product or one that promotes your recent blog post, make sure the look and feel best represent who you are offline and online.Often times, images can do the talking for us on Facebook. They drive engagement by creating a focal point whereby fans can relate and engage over a shared interest.In fact, images are so powerful that a <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33800/Photos-on-Facebook-Generate-53-More-Likes-Than-the-Average-Post-NEW-DATA.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">study by HubSpot</a> of over 8,800 Facebook posts found on business pages, it was found that photos get 53% more likes, 104% more comments, and 84% more click-throughs. Those are exciting statistics to consider as you determine what type of content you will share with your fans.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221c6c28f422eae40b63_facebook-image-engagement.jpeg\" alt=\"facebook photo engagement\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  7. Use Keywords Wisely</h2><p>Keywords, whether in a blog post of Facebook post, work the same. As people search for particular keywords, you want your page to pop up at the top of that search. With Facebook graph search, potential fans are searching for interesting pages based on their interests and your niche.If you are branding a particular keyword, use it within your posts as well as your about section. This does not mean \"stuffing\" a certain keyword over and over again into your content, but working it organically and naturally in to your posts.Remember: keywords are a powerful tool and can be an enormous branding aid. Use them wisely, but frequently.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Implement Automation</h2><p>Schedule your interaction at consistent and regular intervals. While this might sound a little calculating, think about this:  a conversation that is allowed to drop will wither and die. Automation tools are not meant to detract from your online presence, but rather enhance it by allowing you to stay in front of your fans and freeing up your time so you can authentically interact, respond to questions and chime in on other pages within your niche.The bottom line: like it or not,  you need a daily presence to build and expand your page. Automation can help you do that. Whether you choose to use Facebook's scheduling feature within your page or a third-party tool such as <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Sprout Social</a>, get started today rather than letting one more day go by without a posting strategy in place.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221c6c28f48986e40b64_sproutsocial.jpeg\" alt=\"facebook post management tool\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  9. Optimize Your Profile</h2><p>There are many ways to optimize your Facebook profile, each one is a valuable opportunity to catch the attention of your fans and Google alike. So why optimize your profile? It is the first thing people will check out when deciding whether or not they want to LIKE your page, so put a little effort into preparing your content for this section.Have  fun with it and inject your personality. Remember: people connect with humans beings, so make your business approachable. Express what interests you and what topics matter most to you.Include topics of interest and the details that make you unique. It will help others feel like they have a better understanding of who you are, resulting in more subjects to engage in and around.</p><h2 id=\"\">  10. Repurpose Your Current Content</h2><p>You don’t need to reinvent the wheel when more than likely you have an amazing amount of content already available to you. Whether it is offline marketing such as newsletters, flyers or emails or your website content, give that content new life by transforming me it into quick graphics, quick question and answer posts or links to a video tip.</p><h5 id=\"\">And finally, take a moment to think about why your customers use Facebook. What is it that they are looking for?</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">A place to connect with their favorite brands?</li> \t<li id=\"\">A space to share thoughts with like-minded individuals?</li> \t<li id=\"\">A way to be heard and find a voice in an often over-saturated social space?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Answers to their most pressing questions?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Advice on what to buy and whom to buy it from?</li></ul><p>My guess is that it is a combination of each one. Give consumers a pass to your exclusive club that shares the news, events and educational content they are looking for.The only way to create a vibrant community is make your page a destination. If you can make them happy and most importantly, help them understand that you care about their needs, I guarantee you will keep them coming back day after day for more of the same!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Wondering how you can use Pinterest to market your business?I get it!With the ever-evolving world of online marketing, more and more entrepreneurs are targeting internet-savvy customers through Pinterest.Sure, social media channels like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube are great, but Pinterest has become a business marketing powerhouse.While this platform caters to visually driven products, it can work for almost any industry willing to creatively create or re-purpose existing content in an eye-catching way.Ready to start marketing your business with Pinterest? These top 10 Pinterest do’s will make you a better marketer!</p><h1 id=\"\">10 Pinterest Do's That’ll Make You a Better Marketer</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Research</h2><p>Research your target audience and the content they are most interested in pinning. Take the time to identify what images and products speak to them and then share it on well-organized, keyword-rich boards.A little time spent strategically incorporating Pinterest into your marketing strategy will create synergy with your personal brand and other online collateral.It will also encourage pinning and inspire your audience to take further action.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Explain</h2><p>Create boards that offer a detailed description, explain pricing, availability, and location of the product. Do not make your potential clients hunt and peck for information.This causes frustration, and frustration can lead to a lost sales opportunity.Since I love pinning (and wearing) <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/23714335510495525/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">pretty little things</a> and love my pups, including my rescue, this jewelry pin speaks to me in its description, design and spirit in which the company gives.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Captivate</h2><p>Include captivating images that inspire and attract people to your Pinterest page.What pictures make your potential customer oooh and ahhh?Capture those images and share them with those eager to help spread your marketing message enthusiastically!</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Ask</h2><p>Want people to take a specific action? Tell them by including a call to action statement.Too many online marketers shy away from directing a buyer, but that is exactly what you should do.Want them to repin or click-through to your product? Put that in the description or add it as a banner across your image.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Be Genuine</h2><p>Be yourself and show people your creativity. What inspires you and your personal brand? Share that in unique ways that align with who you are and what matters most to you and your consumer.People sense when you aren’t authentic. Transparency breeds trust, and trust builds relationships.Work to share what truly speaks to you. Those clients you want to reach will be drawn to what you share and the tone and voice in which you share it.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Include Keywords</h2><p>Include keywords in your captions. Keywords make an item searchable and can boost SEO and traffic. Your keywords might be your company name, the type of product you offer, or the consumer you are hoping to reach. e.g. health foodUsing these keywords will make a significant difference in your reach and increase the likelihood that your content will appear in the search results.</p><h2 id=\"\">7. Be Original</h2><p>Create original content and pin it to Pinterest, bringing versatility and diverse marketing to your brand. Have you created an original book of recipes that includes a detailed how-to for each one?Share each recipe and how-to’s separately and pin them to boards specific to the food, ingredients, or brand niche.</p><h2 id=\"\">8. Cross Promote</h2><p>Cross promoting your marketing efforts through various social media channels is a best practice you need to implement now if you are not already doing it.Promote your pins by sharing what you are pinning to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Create a “pin of the day” or a “top pin” theme to share content in a fun and engaging way that directs fans and followers back to your Pinterest page.</p><h2 id=\"\">9. Link accounts</h2><p>You can link your Pinterest account to Facebook and Twitter. This shows your followers that you are an active person who they can follow.Engaging with other users is also one of the best ways to promote your product, as they will repin your content.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Verify your website</h2><p>Verify your website to establish credibility and take advantage of Pinterest analytics. The simple steps to take are:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Click on “settings” and then “verify website”</li> \t<li id=\"\">Scroll down to your website url and click on the “verify” button to the right</li> \t<li id=\"\">A pop-up will open with verification instructions. Once this opens, select the “download the html verification file.” (Make sure you save the file in an easy-to-retrieve location and do not close out of the verification page)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Upload the file into the root directory of your website via FTP or CPanel. Return to the verification page within Pinterest and click on the “click here to complete the process.” You should now receive a message below stating that Pinterest successfully verified your website. You can now close and return to your profile for happier pinning!</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">Over to You</h3><p>Pinterest can be an amazing source of traffic, referrals, and sales, and a robust visual marketing tool.How are you using it to market your business?</p>",

Do not underestimate how vital it is to allow time to write a post or creating an image specifically designed for each particular community. It could make the difference between comments and crickets.</em></p><h3 id=\"\">1. Twitter</h3><p id=\"\">Post your article to Twitter and then schedule several additional tweets to go out over the course of the week.</p><p id=\"\">To make the most of this strategy, put a new spin on these tweets by changing up your original article title. This allows you to A/B test which verbiage performs and which falls flat.</p><h3 id=\"\">2.

Maximize Your Profile Potential</h2><p>As with any social site, making the most of your <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/108493275257625053433/posts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google+ profile</a> is an important first step when getting started.Every field within your Google+ profile is an opportunity to connect with your target audience. Take the time to complete every bit of it.</p><h3 id=\"\">A few ways to optimize your profile:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Write your summary using information about you and your business that will connect with those looking for your product or service. Make sure this includes your passion and hobbies that fall outside of your \"job.\" Conversations happen when you share interesting facts and tidbits about yourself.</li> \t<li id=\"\">A professional profile image - Your profile image should be considered a key element to your personal brand. For this reason, it is extremely important that you create consistency from one network to the next by using the same high-quality professional headshot.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use relevant keywords – Do you know people's search terms when looking for your business? Google is eager to tell your story, but without your keywords you could create a situation where consumers have to hunt and peck to find you.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Get local - As you craft your summary, remember to add your industry-specific keywords as well as your location based keywords including city and state.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">2. Write Great Content</h2><p>While this should go without saying, great content should always be at the core of your social media and marketing strategy.Google+ will allow you to share the wealth of information you have gained over the years and will work to establish you as a thought leader within your field. Great content can make the difference between growing your Google+ presence and completely stagnating it.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Manage Your Contacts</h2><p>Google+ Circles is a special feature that allows you to manage contacts based on interest.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221bbde7a7d7c683ce7f_google-plus-circles.jpeg\" alt=\"set up google plus circles\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Filtering your circles creates better targeting where you can share the right content with the right audience.By organizing a circle of potential customers, you can ward off a lot of the noise that takes place in social networks.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Join Niche Specific Communities</h2><p>Google+ communities, similar to Facebook groups, are a way to connect with like-minded individuals. Communities let you talk about the topics that matter to you most, whether it is a community specific to your industry or your favorite hobby.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221bbde7a78a7a83ce7c_google-plus-communities.jpeg\" alt=\"choosing a google plus community\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Closing the Google+ Gap is a community created by <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/104858643838035519891/posts\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a> as a way for active Google Plussers to share best practices and successful strategies around Google+ implementation and integration into your overall social media marketing strategy.</p><h2 id=\"\">5.

Seek them out and thank them. Taking the time to reach out and connect shows how much you value those that assist in spreading your message.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Create a Visually-Rich Experience</h2><p>From your cover photo to your post images, sharing visually appealing images is not only necessary to engagement, but a key component to optimization.Your <a href=\"http://www.websighthangouts.com/google-plus-cover-photo-seo/\" id=\"\">cover photo</a> is also the first thing that someone will see when landing on your Google+ page, so make it consistent with your brand look and feel.<strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Remember:</em></strong><em id=\"\"> </em>Each image you add is yet another opportunity to build upon your brand experience.

Use Google+ Hangouts</h2><p>If you haven't been a part of a Google+ hangout, there's no time like the present! They are fun, engaging and best of all they are FREE.Similar to Skype, a hangout is an opportunity to get face-to-face with consumers and create transparency within your business.

Begin at a high level including each social channel and their corresponding goals.Then begin to add the steps it will take to meet your goals.

Although it is important for marketers and brands to consider the content they are sharing to Pinterest (brand generated content) it is actually the “organic” content (images being shared organically from websites by consumers) that is growing exponentially.Up to 70-85% of all content shared from product-based businesses is organic. This means that consumers are sharing your content even regardless of whether you have a business page on Pinterest or not. Brands need to look at not only what they are putting out there, but also how to optimize both images and their website to allow sharing to happen easily.</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Is there at least one great “pinnable” image on each web page?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Are they encouraging their community to share?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Do they have the PinIt button on images?

Cut-out shapes stand out in the Pinterest newsfeed. Catching more eyes means getting more repins and followers!Instead of square or rectangle, can you make a graphic with a rounded or offbeat shape? If showing a product, try photo’ing it on a crisp white background so the item creates a graphic shape of its own. And be sure to add your company or website name to your images, so whatever happens to them, they’ll always lead the viewer back to YOU.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"acebook-emoticons-fan-engagement\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221be23a167ca73c76cf_facebook-emoticons-fan-engagement.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  9. <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pegfitzpatrick/\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a></h2><p>[caption id=\"attachment_5732\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"200\"]</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"shareable pinterest image\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221be23a1603f63c76cb_shareable-pinterest-image.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p> Copyright: Peg Fitzpatrick[/caption]Peg's tagline tells you everything you need to know about her - Rockin' a positive attitude • passionate about social media • writer • Google+ evangelist • and so much more.

Your Pinterest boards should appeal to your audience, not be a billboard.And since Peg is one of the most giving women I know, she's offered a tool tip as well:PicMonkey is my top tool since the size of the photo is essential for getting your pins seen.

Each illustrates how timing, message, voice, and social network, when effectively combined, can boost visibility, build brand awareness and create a viral sensation.</p><h1 id=\"\">4 Iconic Facebook Marketing Campaigns and Why They Worked</h1><h2 id=\"\">Case Study #1 - Ford's Big Reveal</h2><p>Ford's campaign to reveal the new 2011 Explorer has gone down in history as arguably one of the best Facebook campaigns ever run. What made this campaign remarkable was its use of social media rather than taking the traditional marketing route and unveiling the new model at an auto show. This well-established brand, who many might have thought to be entrenched in an old school marketing methodology, became the first car company to use the web and social media in this way.Although it was only to be a single day event, the 2011 Ford Explorer reveal was a viral sensation as it was broadcast live on Facebook, continuing to gain momentum for days and weeks to come.So why did this campaign work? Ford used that amazing ability of Facebook to \"go viral\" by creating anticipation and buzz around an eagerly anticipated product. The campaign was enhanced by Ford's exceptional use of video, keeping what soon became a clicking frenzy on the move.The final result: seventy-five thousand fans logged on and viewed the auto show. Ford held the number one trending topic position on Twitter for the entire launch day, the number two trending topic on Google, and received over one million views on YouTube.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221b69d01c3ce9092e8e_ford-explorer-2011-facebook-campaign.jpeg\" alt=\"ford explorer 2011 facebook campaign\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Case Study #2 - Ikea's Photo Tagging</h2><p>Ikea, the iconic Swedish furniture company <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/11/25/facebook-marketing-ikeas-genius-use-of-photo-tagging/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">promoted the opening of a new store in Malmo, Sweden</a> on Facebook, using photo tagging as their marketing tool of choice.<em id=\"\">Here's how it worked:</em> Over the span of two weeks, Ikea posted twelve photos of showrooms considered catalog worthy. Fans were then invited to tag the items, with the first person to add their name to a particular piece of furniture winning that item.<em id=\"\">Why it worked:</em> Regarded as one of the lowest-cost demonstrations of the incredible power of Facebook marketing, Ikea's iconic campaign worked due to its simplicity, clear and strategic use of photo tagging and the short window of opportunity that created a frenzy of excitement and immediate virality to each image.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221b69d01c5c39092e90_ikea-facebook-showroom-campaign.jpeg\" alt=\"ikea facebook showroom campaign\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Case Study #3 - Burger King's Sacrifice</h2><p>Perhaps the most controversial Facebook campaign to gain global attention was the Burger King \"sacrifice a friend campaign.\" During this campaign, fans were encouraged to \"sacrifice\" (insert de-friend) ten of their friends to receive a coupon for a free burger.As fans began to delete friends, the Burger King Facebook application would then notify the friends that they had been sacrificed for a burger. This particular aspect to the campaign is believed to be the reason the campaign was eventually shut down, although confirmation never came from Burger King or Facebook.  The impact had already been made when the campaign was shut down.Nearly 234,000 friends had been \"sacrificed\" with more than 23,000 coupons for free Whoppers given away.<em id=\"\">Why it worked: </em>Fans were motivated by their love of a Whopper and could delete<em id=\"\"> </em>friends without worry. They could easily come back and add them again the next day.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221b69d01cbd87092e91_burger-king-whopper-sacrifice.jpeg\" alt=\"burger king whopper sacrifice\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Case Study #4 - Papa John's Pizza</h2><p>Finally, a slightly more mainstream method of marketing, but advertised using only a social network, was the Papa John's Pizza campaign. During the “Papa’s Specialty Pizza Challenge,” fans were challenged to create a new pizza offering that could become the chain's next specialty pizza. The winner would also receive free pizza for life plus proceeds from the winning recipe.As you can imagine, the response was overwhelming, with over 12,000 entries received via Facebook. Only three winners were chosen, each given $1000 to market their creation.<em id=\"\">Why it worked:</em> This simple but effective campaign capitalized on word-of-mouth marketing and worked because Papa John's clearly understood fans love of their pizza.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221b69d01cab50092e8f_papa-johns-facebook-campaign.jpeg\" alt=\"papa johns facebook campaign\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">What Marketers Can Learn</h2><p>The first lesson in this is the value of consumer participation. Each of the brands above harnessed this to their advantage. People always want to be heard and definitely want in in on the fun!The second lesson is capitalizing on human nature. The curious just couldn't resist clicking on the Ford Facebook tab and viewing the \"reveal\" video while others couldn't wait to dump friends only to gain a simple hamburger. The ambitious wanted to show their friends that they could make a really great pizza and the gamblers amongst us took their chances on a a piece of furniture. The bottom line is: understand your audience and their willingness to buy into your campaign and product.The third lesson is found in humans desire to keep up with \"the Jones'.\" Facebook creates a fervor as friends spread the word about a marketing campaign. When one friend takes action, many others will follow suit creating a cascading and in some cases an avalanche effect. No one wants to be left behind or out of a seemingly exciting opportunity, especially not on social media.</p><h3 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">The secret for your next Facebook marketing campaign?

Below are six ways you can spice up your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/being-unforgettable-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media content</a> and re-engage your social media audience!</p><h1 id=\"\">Spice Up Stale Social Media Content</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Pay Attention to Your Analytics</h2><p>Your<a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-analytics-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"> social media analytics</a> have a story to tell. Hunker down and pay attention to what they are saying.What you find is not for the faint of heart.  Be prepared to uncover a few telling reasons your engagement, mentions, and/or +1's have dropped off the map.Analytics are your key to keeping an eye on the prize.While it can be easy to get carried away in the glitz and glory of a growing social presence, maintain a focus on the goals you set at the onset.Make responsible decisions about the direction (and voice) behind the content you share, and be prepared to make adjustments as necessary.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Ask Thought-Provoking Questions</h2><p>The questions you post or tweet should evoke an emotion. Do you want to make your audience think, laugh, cry or excitedly answer? Decide before you share your next piece of content.Take interesting tidbits related to your business or product and turn them into questions your audience can relate to. Make sure to avoid generalities.You want you content to be interesting, appealing and instantly relatable.</p><h4 id=\"\">Examples would be:</h4><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">When you stay in a hotel room, are you a tucked or untucked kind of person?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Do you squeeze the toothpaste from the bottom or top of the tube?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Would you rather spend a weekend in the mountains or lounging on the beac?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What's your favorite way to spend a Saturday?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  3. Incorporate Images, Text and Video</h2><p>People are more likely to be interested in your content if it is diverse. Use a healthy mix of text, Infographics, photographs, charts and video to get your message across.Then test out variations of each and determine with what type of content receives the best response. Just because an image performs best on Facebook, does not mean it will do as well on Google+.The most important component to the success of this strategy is to know what your fans and followers are looking for. Then give it to them over and over again.Oreo does a terrific job at this.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151347834644653&set=a.124804629652.101377.114998944652&type=1\" id=\"\">Post</a> by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/oreo\" id=\"\">Oreo</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Gather Feedback and Opinions</h2><p>Want to know what your fans and followers are thinking? Ask them! Your audience will be happy to tell you.They will also be far more likely to interact with you if you stop simply pushing out content and truly take the time to ask and listen to their needs.Ask questions that will provide insight into what type of content they are interested in, what they would like to see more or less of, and how they like to consume information.Your fans are happy to share, all you have to do is take the time to get to know them.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Be Human and Accessible</h2><p>Being formal is important to maintain your reputation, but do not be afraid to let your fans and followers see behind the curtain every once and while.Pepper in a few posts that contain personal information. Talk about what is happening over the weekend, events you are attending or the inside scoop behind the day-to-day of your business.Sharing more than just business related content builds trust and provides a far more authentic persona for people to connect with. People want to do business with people, give them a glimpse into what makes you tick.<em id=\"\">A side note:</em> If you are uncomfortable with sharing the minute details of your life, that's ok. This does not have to be pictures of you and your family at the neighborhood barbecue.Just remember, sometimes keeping your content light and fun is just as impactful (if not more) than posting the informative pieces you post on a daily basis.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Never Stop Engaging</h2><p>You can't expect people to interact with you if you aren't actively engaging. Never stop retweeting and responding.Stay on top of those that share your content and thank those that do. Engaging with your audience is the quickest way to build rapport and take a relationship beyond the superficial.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">How do you spice up your social media content?

In fact, according to a <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/social-media-facts_b40978\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">recent survey by Balihoo</a>, 23% of brand marketers are actively developing social media strategies, but still struggling to execute.Why? It's simple. They have failed to effectively leverage their brand online by communicating in a way that is appealing and engaging to their target audience.So what exactly should you be doing to increase engagement and connect with the very consumer that is desperate for your product or service?First, you must focus on what your “<strong id=\"\">social interaction” </strong>goals are<strong id=\"\">. </strong></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Ask yourself:</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Who is my customer?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How am I reaching them?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do they care about my message?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are they listening?</li></ul><p>If they’re not listening, what is it that they’re not relating to? Have you spelled out in clear terms what you have to offer, what they can’t live without and how you can solve the problem they’re faced with?Social interaction and business marketing give you the unique opportunity to interact, captivate and call your community to action. This means that as a business owner and entrepreneur you not only need to be listening to your customers, but you must find a way to get their ear. However, before you can do that, you must spell out your goals.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What's Your Social Media Goal?</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What are you using Social Media for?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Whose attention are you trying to gain?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your  style or personality and how will that shine through online?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How will you stay true to your personal brand  message?</li></ul><p>Getting your customers and potential clients to <strong id=\"\">actively “listen” to your message </strong>means you must refine your communication. Focus on what your customer wants. Ask yourself everyday whether your message is beneficial and valuable to their overall needs and desires.</p><h1 id=\"\">Your Investment</h1><p>If you are investing time and resources into social media marketing, taking that energy and making it payoff is a must. But how do you know if you are truly benefiting from the hours spent online?While paying attention to social media metrics and analytics are key, they aren't the only gauge to online success. There is also the human element to social that comes with the daily interaction and relationships we are working to build.So what is it that keeps so many marketers from succeeding in social media? I believe it is a combination of things, but one thing that reigns supreme.Social media can feel overwhelming with tasks such as content creation, curation, tracking and measurement feeling like an enormous undertaking. However, the one thing I have found that reigns supreme in holding marketers back from truly succeeding is simple. <strong id=\"\">It's fear.</strong>Whether it is the fear of failure, the fear that everything must be absolutely perfect, the fear that no one will like what we have to say or the fear that our efforts are in vain, each one prohibits us from truly making the most all that social is capable of accomplishing.<em id=\"\">But what if you could step outside of that fear and into the realm of possibility? You can!</em>J.K. Rowling said,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all --- in which case, you fail by default.\"</blockquote><p>Are you ready to <strong id=\"\">ignite your social media marketing</strong> and in turn, build a business that you love?</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Twitter has changed the way businesses communicate.Consumers are no longer required to pick up the phone or send an email to learn more about you, your product or service.They are actively researching, listening and learning about your company in real-time.As business owners and brands, getting your marketing message out and heard is critical.Twitter levels the playing field allowing small to mid-sized companies to cast their marketing net further than ever before.However, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/3-tips-to-gain-a-quality-twitter-following/\" id=\"\">gaining a loyal Twitter following</a> is easier said then done. Below are eleven simple tactics to get more Twitter followers!</p><h1 id=\"\">Get More Twitter Followers (the right way)</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Share Quality Content</h2><p>While this one should go without saying, it is always worth repeating. Quality content gives people a reason to share, comment and come back for more.Are you a blogger? Re-purpose your content to give it an added boost. Turn a post or survey into an Infographic or share a single quote or thought to elevate the conversation and begin to better brand your tweets.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Shareable content has a purpose. There is a passion and authenticity behind it, a vision driven by goals. <a href=\"http://t.co/wXfeBjMTHx\" id=\"\">http://t.co/wXfeBjMTHx</a>— Rebekah Radice (@RebekahRadice) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RebekahRadice/statuses/346684160183771136\" id=\"\">June 17, 2013</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">2. Know Your Niche</h2><p>Understanding who your potential consumer is and what needs you can solve is vital when crafting content.Steve Keating is laser-focused on the needs of his followers. He provides quality tweets on a daily basis that speak to the sales professional and leader.</p><blockquote id=\"\">If you can't care about more than yourself then you can't care enough to truly lead.— Steve Keating CSE (@LeadToday) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeadToday/statuses/346248634813263872\" id=\"\">June 16, 2013</a></blockquote><p>Consider this as well. While many say to avoid politics or religion, that might not be the right solution for your business.Twitter offers a platform where being a little controversial might be a great way for you to start a dialog. The important component is to always put the needs of your followers first.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Be Honest</h2><p>When asking for followers, do not trick them into following. Be straightforward in your intentions and make it clear what you like to talk about or what your opinions are.Expectations up front will connect you with the right people and avoid frustration and eventually, a loss in followers who feel mislead.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Use Hashtags</h2><p>Use hashtags to find people and topics centered around subjects you are interested in. #Ford for example would introduce you to fellow Ford enthusiasts who are eager to chat about their favorite topic.</p><blockquote id=\"\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Ford&src=hash\" id=\"\">#Ford</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/KRXB1hHpK4\" id=\"\">pic.twitter.com/KRXB1hHpK4</a>— Lifted Trucks (@_LiftedTrucks_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_LiftedTrucks_/statuses/346469510653550593\" id=\"\">June 17, 2013</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">5. Join Twitter Chats</h2><p>Twitter chats are an excellent way to connect with like-minded individuals who are tweeting about the same content that excites you.Check the frequently updated <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmJtCr86zqMcdERuZXB0TXlBUjlLbFBmSVExYTNzYUE&usp=sharing\" id=\"\">Twitter chat schedule</a>The largest chat on Twitter, #Blogchat is one I recently joined and truly enjoy. It is a weekly chat about topics helpful to anyone blogging personally or professionally. Hosted by Mack Collier, topics cater to newbies as well as advanced. This means you can connect with people that are talking about what interests you. Build deeper, more meaningful connections through Twitter chats!</p><blockquote id=\"\">If you missed last night's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Blogchat&src=hash\" id=\"\">#Blogchat</a> on our fav WP plugins, here's the transcript - <a href=\"https://t.co/TfpWVqyGW4\" id=\"\">https://t.co/TfpWVqyGW4</a>— Mack Collier (@MackCollier) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MackCollier/statuses/346633371188862976\" id=\"\">June 17, 2013</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">6. Brand Your Twitter Channel</h2><p>Take advantage of the customization options Twitter options including a branded background, adding your professional head shot and filling out your bio.Take your time to carefully write a bio that expresses who you are, how your business can help consumers (this is your answer to the \"what's in it for me\" question) and above all else, be authentic. Take your offline personality and accurately convey that on Twitter.Nobody has a more authentic brand then <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a>. Whether you land on her blog or her Google+ profile, each picture, word and post screams \"positively Peggy.\"As the Queen of Google+, she also stays true to her love of that platform by sharing great G+ tidbits often! The key here? Your personal brand is about more than a look or feel. It's incorporated into your tone, voice and content shared.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Get ready to rock your Google+ <a href=\"http://t.co/jK6rrzVRyf\" id=\"\">http://t.co/jK6rrzVRyf</a>— Peg Fitzpatrick (@PegFitzpatrick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PegFitzpatrick/statuses/346688784538140674\" id=\"\">June 17, 2013</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">7. Get Engaged</h2><p>Get involved in the conversation and make it a point to stay actively engaged. It's not enough to schedule a few tweets. You must <strong id=\"\">begin to create conversation</strong>.Ask questions and craft them in a way that they are worth replying to. People and content are moving rapidly. Give them a statement worth replying to. Reply in kind and open the lines of communication.</p><h2 id=\"\">8. Don't Haphazardly Follow</h2><p>Be strategic in who you follow. What is your niche, passion, favorite pastime or hobby? Follow people that share information similar to what you find interesting.A few <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/essential-twitter-tools/\" id=\"\">Twitter tools</a> to find people to follow:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.twellow.com/\" id=\"\">Twellow</a> - A directory of public Twitter accounts, with hundreds of categories and search features to help you find people who matter to you.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.wefollow.com\" id=\"\">WeFollow</a> - Get the most out of Twitter by finding the right people to share the conversation: find new, like-minded friends.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://justtweetit.com/\" id=\"\">Just Tweet It</a> - A user directory for Twitter organized by genre to allow for users to easily find other Twitter users to connect with.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">9. Be Helpful</h2><p>If you are only using Twitter to push out your marketing message, you are missing a huge opportunity. Twitter allows you to <strong id=\"\">offer great content that provides a benefit</strong>. Share helpful information that solves a problem or provides a solution.What content do you have sitting on your website or blog that could be shared in bite-sized snippets? Take your frequently asked questions, company about or top tips and use them as helpful and meaningful tweets.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Cross Promote</h2><p>Use your <strong id=\"\">existing social media accounts</strong> like Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest to cross-promote your Twitter channel. It's a good marketing practice to drive people back to other social properties.Not everyone chooses to engage on each social network, make sure you remind people where you are and how you would like them to connect with you.</p><h2 id=\"\">11.

Terry is a rockstar when it comes to retweeting, sharing and actively supporting his community. He is someone I met a while back and has now connected with my hubby.

Pinterest analytics is a free feature, thus leaving the scope and depth of the data very limited in my opinion. Details such as demographics, age, gender, country or city are not available.Pinterest analytics are only tied to content shared from your verified website. This means that pins from any other source will not be tracked and included in your stats. This is an unfortunate loss of data for any business sharing unique content as well as curating content.</p><h1 id=\"\">Getting Started with Pinterest Analytics</h1><h2 id=\"\">Step 1: Get the New Look</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282219f47c95cc3e3e049a_switch-to-new-pinterest-look.jpeg\" alt=\"switch-to-new-pinterest-look\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>In order to view Pinterest analytics you will need to transition your account to the “new look” or new layout. To do this, click on the dropdown menu in the right hand corner and choose “switch to new look.”</p><h2 id=\"\">Step 2: Verify Your Website</h2><p>As mentioned above, only accounts with a verified website are able to access this free tool. Follow the steps below to confirm ownership of your website:Click on “settings” and then “verify website”Scroll down to your website url and click on the “verify” button to the rightA pop-up will open with verification instructions. Once this opens, select the “download the html verification file.” (Make sure you save the file is in an easy to retrieve location and do not close out of the verification page)Upload the file into the root directory of your website via FTP or CPanel Return to the verification page within Pinterest and click on the “click here to complete the process.” You should now receive a message below stating that Pinterest successfully verified your website. You can now close out and return to your profile for more happy pinning!</p><h2 id=\"\">Step 3: Access Pinterest Analytics</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282219f47c953b583e0498_access-pinterest-analytics.jpeg\" alt=\"access-pinterest-analytics\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Navigate to the dropdown menu in the right hand corner and choose “analytics.”You will now see a page including tabs labeled:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Site Metrics</li> \t<li id=\"\">Most Pinned</li> \t<li id=\"\">Most Recent</li> \t<li id=\"\">Most Clicked</li></ul><p>Data displayed within your site metrics:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Pins / Pinners - the daily average number of pins and number of people who pinned from your website</li> \t<li id=\"\">Repins - the daily average number of times pins from your website were repinned on Pinterest</li> \t<li id=\"\">Repinners – the daily average number of people who repinned your pins</li> \t<li id=\"\">Impressions – the daily average number of times your pins appeared on Pinterest in the main feed, in search results, or on boards</li> \t<li id=\"\">Reach – the daily average number of people who saw your pins on Pinterest</li> \t<li id=\"\">Clicks - the daily average number of clicks to your website that came from Pinterest</li> \t<li id=\"\">Visitors – the daily average number of people who visited your website from Pinterest</li></ul><p>From here you are able to export your statistics and analyze to determine whether your efforts are meeting your business objectives.

Each one is something I use within my own business and will hopefully be a benefit in yours as well.I decided to begin with a fundamental tool that has enabled me to effortlessly stay up-to-date with my favorite bloggers while scouring the Internet for share-worthy content. That tool, up until a few weeks ago, was Google Reader.Google's decision to <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html\" id=\"\">shut down Google Reader</a> as of July 1st, 2013 has left many people scurrying for an alternative. As a fervent user of Google Reader for many years, I can understand the panic over its loss. The good news is that there are several other <strong id=\"\">viable RSS options</strong>, but none as well suited for my needs as Feedly.I love Feedly for several reasons: the easy <strong id=\"\">migration of data from Google Reader to Feedly</strong>, its beautiful and clean magazine-type layout, and the seamless integration with Buffer.

      "wp-content": "<p>Facebook is an excellent tool for building your business. But many business professionals still struggle to create Facebook engagement.By making your Facebook Page a destination for timely information and engaging interaction, you increase business opportunities and boost your recognition factor.</p><h1 id=\"\">12 Most Powerful Ways to Create Facebook Engagement</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Set up an attractive timeline</h2><p>Facebook is a visual medium. Make sure your page includes links to webinars that you have conducted, upcoming events you are hosting, YouTube videos, as well as in-depth information about products and services.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Keep it fresh</h2><p>Post daily and keep your content fresh and relevant. Change up your posts by using images, links, video and other media to monitor what works best in your community.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Maximize your marketing value</h2><p>Use your cover image as a marketing tool, but be mindful of Facebook’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/search/?q=cover+guidelines\" id=\"\">strict cover image guidelines</a>. The cover image allows you to display a photo that is unique to your business, including anything from your “fan of the month” to an upcoming product or event.You also want to update your cover frequently to keep your page fun and interesting.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Use images to draw fans in</h2><p>As Pinterest has proven, consumers love eye candy. Use images that are a banquet for the eyes. The goal here is to choose a beautiful photograph that will immediately intrigue and delight the eye.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Put in the time</h2><p>It is a given that receiving comments, likes and shares are the goal of your page, so make it a priority to put time and effort into the construction of each post. Hopping on Facebook and throwing up a quick post is not a marketing strategy.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Engagement is an active sport</h2><p>Visit your page frequently and actively connect with your fans. Engaging daily with your community is the quickest and most effective way to build trust and credibility.</p><h2 id=\"\">7. Create conversation starters</h2><p>Invite feedback by asking open ended questions that can lead to long and lively discussions. Ask for responses — simply ending your message with a “what do you think?” or “do you agree?” can often get the party started.</p><h2 id=\"\">8. Build a following by “going viral”</h2><p>The multiplication possibilities via Facebook are similar to the magic of compound interest. Here’s how it works: When your friends and fans repost and comment on your page, the information spreads to their friends’ lists, and can be picked up repeatedly by another “generation” of friends.In that manner, the reach of your message can be unlimited. This is the Facebook version of “going viral.”</p><h2 id=\"\">9. Make it easy to react</h2><p>The more entertaining your posts are and the easier they are to react to (think short and sweet), the more likely it becomes that your reach will naturally expand through multiple re-postings.Use “yes or no” and “this or that” type questions to allow fans to quickly react without having to think through a long response.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Inject humor into your page</h2><p>A humorous message that makes your community laugh will often engage an audience in a way that keeps readers coming back. If people look forward to your posts, it is a hook that strengthens the ties to your page.Just be careful when using humor and keep it appropriate for your audience.</p><h2 id=\"\">11. Use testimonials</h2><p>Testimonials extolling the virtues of your business go a long way in building credibility.Do not discount the power past client testimonials have in adding social proof to your sales and service claims.</p><h2 id=\"\">12. Be responsive</h2><p>Always monitor your fan page so that you can respond to questions and comments quickly. It keeps the discussion and interest up, shows appreciation for those who are reaching out to you, and is the ideal opportunity to engage with new people.Facebook is about connecting socially and can be a powerful networking tool if you focus your efforts on building and maintaining an entertainingly informative fan page.I would love to hear how you are using Facebook in your business.Comment and share below!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>The clock ticks and your head spins. It’s a typical Monday morning full of buzzing to-do’s and beeping reminders.As you sit and stare blankly at your computer, longing for inspiration to leap from the page, you wonder why it is so difficult to<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/24-ideas-to-rock-your-social-media-content-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"> find a blog topic worth writing about</a>.If this scenario sounds familiar, know that you are not alone. It is the same frustration felt by many bloggers when it comes to generating fresh and unique content on a consistent basis.However, finding a creative space to organize thoughts and capture ideas is a necessity for anyone eager to simplify the writing process and eliminate the stress and aggravation centered on and around content creation.So how do you get there? You need an editorial calendar.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why You Need an Editorial Calendar</h2><p>One of the best ways to <strong id=\"\">produce continual content is through an editorial calendar</strong>. <strong id=\"\">Creating an editorial marketing calendar</strong> will act as your daily content guide. Rather than sitting and staring blankly at your computer screen when it comes to write, your inspiration will have been previously created.With an <strong id=\"\">editorial calendar</strong> you can act on purpose, writing based on goals strategically outlined within your overall marketing plan. It will eradicate time sucking activities that have no return on investment (ROI) and create a scenario where you look forward to time spent writing rather than agonizing over hours spent researching, brainstorming and beating your creatively challenged head against the wall.</p><h2 id=\"\">Creating Your Editorial Calendar</h2><p>Creating your content calendar can be as simple or as detailed as you want to make it. You can use excel, Google drive or a word doc depending on your comfort level and needs.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282219f9d51a30c6811f37_editorial-calendar-template.jpeg\" alt=\"editorial calendar template\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The most important element as you begin to outline your calendar is determining <strong id=\"\">what topics matter most to your customers</strong>. This will require time and research as you take a deep dive into the wants and needs of your potential clients.This is where a tool such as <strong id=\"\">Google Analytics</strong> will be incredibly helpful. Identify the top keywords and phrases your audience is actively searching for online. Those terms will then become your monthly categories.For example, if you are a bakery blogging about everything from cupcakes to birthday cakes, your monthly categories might look something like this:</p><h3 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">January: </em></h3><p>Crazy for Cookies</p><h3 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">February:</em></h3><p>Death by Chocolate</p><h3 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">March:</em></h3><p>Unforgettable Cupcake CreationsYour next step is to fill those twelve month categories with <strong id=\"\">timely and relevant sub-categories of weekly content. </strong>Each topic should be designed to grab the attention and loyalty of potential consumers.Your sub-categories or blog topics might look something like this:</p><h3 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">January: </em></h3><p>Crazy for Cookies</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Week 1: The top no-bake recipes you can make in a snap</li><li> \tMelt in your mouth peanut butter cookies \t</li><li id=\"\">No bake oatmeal cookies</li> \t<li id=\"\">Week 2: Chocolate chip cookies you can't stop eating</li><li> \tHow to make the best chocolate chip cookie your family has ever tasted \t</li><li id=\"\">10 minute chocolate chip cookies</li> \t<li id=\"\">Week 3: Our best-loved recipes</li><li> \tA snicker-doodle family recipe \t</li><li id=\"\">Our delicious sugar cookies made from scratch</li></ul><p>As you can see, you begin by taking your category or theme and breaking it down into weekly articles that share everything from top tips to company events. It will all depend on your audience, industry and whether or not your business is affected by seasonal changes, holidays or upcoming product launches.</p><h2 id=\"\">Create a Plan to Share Your Content</h2><p>Your next step is to determine where and how you will share your post. Decide which <strong id=\"\">social media channels</strong> you will share your post across. Create a separate column in your content calendar for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Pinterest with an example of <strong id=\"\">which type of media you will share</strong>.Will it be an image, link, video, Infographic, whitepaper or free downloadable eBook? Repurposing your content for social media is a vital piece of the blogging process and must be incorporated into your content calendar.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428220baa3462ca265258dd_social-media-calendar.jpeg\" alt=\"social media calendar\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>I choose to spread my content out over a three-day period rather than inundating all of my online properties at once. This allows for a more organic reach and continued traffic throughout the week.Using a color code system is also an easy way to keep track of your weekly routine. Identify where you will post on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and so on. Putting this type of detail into your content calendar will create habits needed for blog sustainability.If blogging is important to the health and success of your business, schedule the time for tasks and add them to your calendar as non-negotiable commitments.</p><h2 id=\"\">Content Calendar Downloads</h2><p>Give yourself the gift of clarity that only a calendar can bring!

      "wp-content": "<p>I was recently invited to join Kelly Mitchell on her podcast <a href=\"http://www.agentcaffeine.com/category/brevetv-guests/\" id=\"\">Breve TV</a> where we discussed how brands are communicating via social media.It was a lively and fast-paced conversation that explored how brands, both large and small are managing, monitoring and directly engaging with consumers on a daily basis. You can <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3QFTmpZwXn4\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">see the complete broadcast here</a>.As I prepared for the show, I realized that<strong id=\"\"> managing the online presence of a brand</strong> is not too dissimilar to that of <a href=\"http://bhgrealestateblog.com/2013/03/08/social-media-and-beyond-building-your-digital-footprint/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">managing your own personal online presence</a>. Each requires that you are actively engaged and eager to listen, react and respond on a consistent basis. It also necessitates that you maintain an insatiable desire to understand and satisfy the needs of your target consumer.So why then is it so difficult for so many to find their voice, their rhythm and their groove online? I believe they are missing a few key ingredients.</p><h2 id=\"\">A Clearly Defined Brand</h2><p>Your personal brand conveys a powerful message to consumers. It is the image that connects potential buyers with your product or service and expresses why they should work with you.With the evolution of social media, <strong id=\"\">your brand now lives offline as well as online</strong>. It exists in your daily conversations and is evidenced in the content you share. From images to status updates, consumers are forming an opinion and making a decision that affects your bottom line.There is no better person to communicate your vision to the world than you.<strong id=\"\"> </strong>Determine what makes your brand special and commit to sharing that day-in and day-out.</p><h2 id=\"\">A Hit or Miss Social Media Strategy</h2><p>Before you dive in, know the answers to the following questions:</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Is your goal engagement, brand awareness, sales or all of the above? Determine what benefits you are looking to receive and how you can amplify your message by increasing conversation across multiple social media channels.</li>\t<li id=\"\">What are your consumers looking for and how will you provide answers, solutions and a compelling product that solves their needs on a consistent basis?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What topics are your target audience passionate about and what do they love to talk about?<strong id=\"\"> </strong></li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Missing a Social Media Voice</h2><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">First and foremost, finding your voice entails knowing who you are and <strong id=\"\">what unique abilities you bring to the table</strong>. In essence, it means taking a look inside and truly appreciating what makes you, YOU. Once you have a firm grasp on what makes you awesome, translate that across your social networks in a real and authentic way. Remember, social media moves at a rapid pace. If you are not a direct reflection online of who you are offline, your message will get blurred and sharing that message unfailingly becomes very difficult.</li></ul><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Never forget that social media is all about being social. The quickest way I know how to find your voice is to <strong id=\"\">get involved in the conversation</strong>. Sure it can be scary to put yourself out there, but dipping your toe in the water is the best way to understand whether or not your story or voice is resonating with your target audience. If also allows you to determine whether or not the content you are sharing has struck a chord.</li></ul><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">If you are <strong id=\"\">building your personal brand</strong> under the umbrella of a national brand, it is a must that you align your voice with the company culture.

While it is true that certain tasks can be automated or outsourced, <strong id=\"\">conveying your brand personality and message</strong> is something you need to own.While automation may save you time in the long run, think of what you ultimately lose by not being active and involved. As a business, the goal is to connect with the right consumer. Social media allows you to meet them where they spend the majority of their time in a way that we have never been able to do before.If you truly want to see a return on your time and <strong id=\"\">make social media a successful part of your marketing strategy</strong>, then you must join the conversation.

How to create social media conversations that captivate and inspire your online community.</p><h1 id=\"\">Create Captivating Social Media Conversations</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Be Curious</h2><blockquote id=\"\"><em id=\"\">We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths. ~ Walt Disney</em></blockquote><p>Curiosity in marketing is no different than it is in life. Curiosity keeps us fresh, inventive, and open to new and unique ideas.Never stop learning, adapting, and re-energizing your strategy.Whether your current marketing efforts are flourishing or failing, curiosity is a quality you must maintain.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Get Creative</h2><p>Ever wonder why your social media efforts aren’t producing the results you were hoping for? It could be due to a lack of creativity.Just as our offline or traditional marketing can become stale over time, so can our online marketing.Spice things up! Take a good hard look at the posts, tweets, and content you are producing. What is the tone behind it? Is it presenting you or your company in the best light?Ask yourself what the benefit is to your follower, reader, or fan. If there isn’t one, it’s time to make a change.Be innovative, electrifying, and most of all -- be original. Your social success is dependent on it!</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Stay Connected</h2><p>Connecting in a real and authentic way is key to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/stand-online/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media success</a>, no matter the size of your company. This makes it imperative that you spend time conversing with your fans, followers, and friends daily.Responding, commenting, and engaging proves you're a real human being, not a systematic robot.It also creates trust, which is the foundation of a healthy and beneficial relationship.There is no better way to reach those you are wishing to stay in front of than getting (and staying) socially connected.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Remain Consistent</h2><p>When was the last time you landed on a social profile or blog that wasn't updated in months? I would imagine it did for you what it does for me.It sheds a dim light on the company and speaks volumes about its willingness to follow through.Give your fans and followers a reason to keep coming back. Commit to posting, tweeting, and engaging consistently.This means that you will need to know your limitations.What can you commit to that won't be a hardship?Take baby steps and understand that you do not have to be everywhere or everything to everyone all at once. Determine where your target market spends their time and then show up regularly!</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Become Coordinated</h2><p>Get your social media coordinated! This will take a mix of strategy, planning, and the right tools to execute.Maximize your social media marketing strategy by leveraging each social channel and your blog.<strong id=\"\">For example:</strong> If you post to your blog, coordinate your efforts to publish it across the web. From Google+, Facebook and Twitter, use social media to help spread your message.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tools to help automate your efforts:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"bufferapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Buffer </a>- Far and away, one of my favorite tools, Buffer is a smarter way to schedule the great content you find. Fill up your <em id=\"\">Buffer</em> at one time in the day and <em id=\"\">Buffer</em> automagically posts</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">IFTTT</a> - Connect two applications (Pinterest and Twitter, for example - see the recipe here) and then determine how you will automate that task based on specific parameters.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-to-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">WP to Twitter</a> -- Send a Tweet from your blog or website</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a id=\"\">Leenk.me</a>  -- Auto Tweet new blog posts</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a id=\"\">Social Media Pack - Twitter Module</a> -- Sends a Tweet when you post something new</li></ul><p>Then keep track of how many times someone shared, tweeted, or buzzed your content with <a href=\"http://www.markerly.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Markerly</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Stay Current</h2><p>Remaining relevant requires that you stay up-to-date on the latest trends within your industry.RSS feeds, bookmarking sites, and apps like <a href=\"http://feedly.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Feedly</a> will allow for quick browsing and sharing.Know what impacts your industry, and then share how it affects your fans and followers. It keeps you in the know and ahead of both negative and positive changes.Share important, timely, and beneficial information to build credibility and thought leadership.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Always Capitalize</h2><p>A smart social media marketer creates opportunities through meaningful conversation.They also know how and when to capitalize on that opportunity. They are quick to act and don’t spend an inordinate amount of time agonizing over the decision.They are clear, precise, and swift to evolve and push beyond any self-imposed boundaries. They keep their eyes and mind open and are willing to let go of any fear holding them back.They know that the sooner they engage, the quicker they will feel connected to their community.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">What one change can you make to create vibrant and captivating social media conversations?</em></h4>",

As a sales professional, the opportunity to cast a larger net is intriguing.   Social media while it seems to be a bit more personal then traditional media is truly no different then any other marketing campaign.  If we lack strategy, focus and the ability to track our progress, frustration will inevitably set in.Succeeding in social media can happen if you understand where your time and energy is best spent.  The key is to keep your eye and your attention on the top three social media platforms -- Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and put every other new “bell and whistle” aside.</p><h3 id=\"\">Facebook Marketing for Newbies</h3><p>Whether you connect personally or via a business page, Facebook gives potential customers the opportunity to get to know who you are, and what your business is all about in a very real way.Your first goal with Facebook marketing is to locate and connect with users that are in need of your services.  So how can you find them?1.  Plan Your Facebook PageFirst things first.  Before diving into Facebook marketing, you must determine what type of information you will provide.  Whether it’s home buyer tips, design tricks or how to plant a garden, make sure your content is relevant to your community.  It should also motivate and inspire people to engage and interact with your page.Building a Facebook community takes time, but never forget that this is an extension of your business. You should always work to grab the attention of your fans and cause them to want to take action.Follow this formula on a daily basis to stay true to your message and your purpose:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282217aa34621ce0525932_Social-Media-Daily-Schedule.png\" alt=\"Social Media Daily Schedule\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>2.  Design Your Landing PageA landing page is nothing more than a single web page designed to capture leads.What will your offer consist of? If it’s a free report, you will need an opt-in form and the ability to capture a name and email.  A free tool is Mailchimp or a paid option is AWeber.Include information about you and your service and of course contact information.You can design free landing pages with <a href=\"http://www.pagemodo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pagemodo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wix.com/upgrade/wix-facebook-templatest\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">WIX</a> or <a href=\"http://iframes.wildfireapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Wildfire</a>.  Each one offers pre-created design templates that are simple to edit and pretty to look at for those concerned with color scheme, logo placement, etc…Once you have your design in place, it’s time to get on Facebook and start the creation process.3.  Create Your Facebook PageOne of the main benefits of a business page versus your personal page is the fact that it will be seen by Google.  If you have built a group in the past, the reason you want to consider building a page is:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Content of Fan page is seen by Google</li> \t<li id=\"\">Content of Group Pages is not seen by Google</li> \t<li id=\"\">No custom applications (like opt in page) allowed on Group Pages</li></ul><p>An important part of this process is naming your page.  Since your page will be indexed by  Google, using keywords specific to your niche or area might be a better choice then using your own name.  It really depends on how you have branded yourself up until this point.  In my case, I brand my name, not a company or service.  That may change in the future but for now I am the brand.Spend time thinking this piece through before moving forward.  Facebook gives you one “do-over” to rename your page but that is only before you have 100 fans.Your Facebook page will be attached and managed through your personal profile. Once you are logged in, navigate to <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php\" id=\"\">http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php</a>.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282217aa346246b3525934_Facebook-Page-Setup.png\" alt=\"Facebook Page Setup\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Follow the step-by-step instructions to setup your Facebook page.  Complete the info, bio and contact information to include your value proposition.</p><h3 id=\"\">Next Steps</h3><p>Craft your content, determine your posting strategy and stay consistent!  Your Facebook fans will only engage if you provide valuable information that meets their needs.  Poll your community often to ensure your message is being heard.Between Facebook insights and the various metric and analytic tools available, there is no reason you should blindly market.  Measure and track your posts and engagement to make the most of your time and efforts!Up next in our 3-part series – How to Use Twitter to Market and Explode Your Business in 2012!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>The New Year is here and with that comes new possibilities.Limitless possibilities filled with the hope of a better tomorrow and change that will magnificently impact who we are, what we are and why we are if we choose to embrace it.Maybe you feel burnt out or stuck in a rut. Maybe you’re frustrated with the way this last year turned out.Maybe you need change and not just for the sake of change.Maybe your mind, body and soul are crying out for ‘dramatic, electrifying, curl your toes, warm your heart, butterflies in your tummy’ kind of change.So why not make a conscious decision to create change within your life rather than committing to yet another empty resolution?Most resolutions are, after all, merely wishes made with little desire to follow through. Change on the other hand will come in all shapes and sizes.It can be made in the smallest of gestures and felt in the tiniest of ways. It can also take shape on a daily basis if we believe that what we do, say and fill our minds with has the ability to mold that change.</p><h1 id=\"\">7 Steps to Creating Positive Change for the New Year</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. See it, feel it, believe in it </h2><p>Until you are ready and willing to make a change in your life, the possibility of change will continue to elude you. As the saying goes..”when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.” The same is true for change in all of our lives.Subconsciously we hang onto all of our past mistakes, bad habits and self-defeating beliefs.Letting go of those and embracing change is not easy and in fact, can be quite painful. But the end result and the feeling of freedom that follows is more then worth the journey.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Embrace it </h2><p>Simply being aware of change is not enough. You must embrace the opportunity and encourage the possibility within your own life.Have you ever felt like you were standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to make a leap but something was holding you back?That something is fear of the unknown. Fear of change. What possibility is passing you by right this moment because you are afraid to make that leap?</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Romance it </h2><p>Take that change out on a date and live with it for a bit. Is it the change you were seeking or maybe just a pit stop on your way to the ultimate opportunity?Whether it is your final destination or just a much needed night out on the town; your change will happen when and if you are ready to accept it.<em id=\"\">Ask yourself this question:</em> What are you risking by not stepping outside of the invisible bubble you’ve surrounded yourself with and leaping into the light of possibility?</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Understand it </h2><p>Understanding how change affects you and how you in turn respond is important insight.Look back on previous change within your life; how did you react? Did you seize the opportunity and embrace it with open arms or did you fight it and push back with all of your might?Maria Robinson once said, <em id=\"\">“Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.” </em>What change can you embark upon that will breathe life into your new ending?</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Accept it </h2><p>Once you understand, embrace and believe in your change, the next step is acceptance.Acceptance is the moment you realize that change is an inevitable part of our lives and allows us to grow beyond our own preconceived limitations.While last year might have brought unwanted change into your life, now is the time to create your own destiny and map that change without the tug of woulda, coulda or shoulda’s.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Don’t Get Derailed </h2><p>The hardest part to any new endeavor is the anxiety felt when you believe you aren’t making progress fast enough. Stay focused on what is most important to you about this change. What end result do you desire and how will you feel when you get there?Change is never easy and you will find yourself feeling frustrated and defeated along the way. Don’t give up!Track your progress through a journal, calendar or even a girlfriend. However you prefer to keep track of all that’s transpiring in your life, make sure you reflect on your accomplishments.It can make a world of difference on those days you want to throw in the towel.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong> 7. Celebrate Your Success! </h2><p>The road to change is littered with broken promises, unfulfilled goals and feelings of doubt and self-worth. Don’t become a tragedy along that path.Strive to make your change one that stick<strong id=\"\">s</strong> by celebrating your success along the way. A celebration can be a scoop of your favorite ice cream or the new pair of shoes you have been dying to buy.The most important part of this is that you don’t deny yourself the simple pleasure of patting yourself on the back and saying “job well done!”</p>",
