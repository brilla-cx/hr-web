This allows for the creation of dynamic and immersive visual experiences that can be used in a variety of settings, including live events, architectural installations, and advertising. The technique involves using specialized software to align the projected image with the contours of the surface it is being projected onto, in order to create a seamless and realistic effect.</p>",

We believe time is the most valuable commodity we have.

Benchmarks</h3><p id=\"\">First, we'll compare our current pricing to competitive/market benchmarks. It's a good idea to refer to a credible source. In doing so, we not only compare the current rates being charged by self-employed professionals, but also what our clients pay for the same services in house. </p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rGCKXIKt-7l5gX06NAwO3pjqEHh-oPXtB8ihkp0vGWo/edit#gid=382484678\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">This is a great find</a>. It's a huge open-sourced Google Sheet of salaries and demographics. When we review the data (sheet above + our completed jobs + public job postings) we find a wide range of market prices. </p><p id=\"\">From $60,000 full-time to $270,000. Our rates fall well within that range, towards the lower high-end at $175,440 per year on a full-time basis ($85 x 172h a month x 12) including benefits etc.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Value</h3><p id=\"\">This may seem subjective, because it is. But here we go. We first assess a value on our time. Beginning with our personal time. This helps define the perceived value of our professional time. </p><p id=\"\">For us, the assessment is, high! It probably should be the same for you too.</p><p id=\"\">Then we have to rationalize that against client perception. I mean Ambreen's mom thinks she's the best and her time invaluable. It doesn't mean people are going to pay a premium for it. This comes down to the simple metric of \"What's a client willing to pay me?\"</p><p id=\"\">The final variable to consider here is ROI. Is it tangible? Is it perceived? Meaning, does my time‚Äîthat my client pays for‚Äîlead to a measurable benefit for them? </p><p id=\"\">Do they realize it? E.g. if my services are performed overnight vs. my client's time, then there's a perceived performance benefit because they're getting results before the start of the next day.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Price</h3><p id=\"\">We've understood the market, the competition, assessed our value on time, and determined whether or not that value is perceived by our clients. In light of which, we've decided that an increase to our pricing for the Creative Director of $10/hr. is fair and reasonable, considering the fact that hot dogs in the latest episode of Yellowstone cost 9 bucks. <br><br>New rate: $95.</p><p id=\"\">Next steps, inform all active contracts of the increase with reasonable notice, because we love us some üå≠!</p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">We're building an open-sourced tool to help you with pricing.

It marks nine years since I lost my mom. Her birthday is at the end of the month. </p><p id=\"\">Since moving closer to my family, I have heard tales from her younger years which has been nice. They told me how my parents first met and filled me in on the details of when and why my mom relocated to the United States with two of my aunts. They also shared a hilarious story that we won't go into here. üòÇ</p><p id=\"\">My mother was a strong-willed woman who grounded us for disrespecting her house. She‚Äôd yell at us if we didn't clean the way she liked.</p><p id=\"\">Despite her stubbornness, she was an amazing woman who cared not only for her children but also for her siblings, their children, and family friends.</p><p id=\"\">She was selfless and stopped going to school at an early age to help support her siblings. That‚Äôs how she was for the rest of her life. </p><p id=\"\">I always imagined her helping me raise my kids. Even though she‚Äôs not physically here, I know she‚Äôs still helping me watch over my son. </p><p id=\"\">It‚Äôs months like this that I am grateful we were able to move close to family. </p><p id=\"\">It‚Äôs hard not having her with us, but the recollections we share of her are what keep her memory alive. üíó</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1200px\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"Mountains and Palm Trees in the style of Star Wars\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/641f1f955f77905140eb8ad0_oregon-la.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Mountains and Palm Trees in the style of Star Wars | Hugging Face by Stable Diffusion 2.1</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"\">PACIFIC NORTHWEST TO WEST</h2><h3 id=\"\">‚òÇÔ∏è Umbrella refusal</h3><p id=\"\">I grew up in Los Angeles and moved to Las Vegas when I was 17. I had only ever known hot weather.</p><p id=\"\">I visited both Seattle and Portland a few years before I moved there and fell in love right away. It was gloomy, cloudy, and raining‚Äîperfect for me. </p><p id=\"\">Let‚Äôs clear something up first. There‚Äôs this notion that it rains all the time up there. That‚Äôs not entirely true. It rains during the winter which is when I went to visit. It‚Äôs also not pouring, but more of a sprinkling than anything. All you need is a light jacket. If you‚Äôve visited or lived there you know the saying - <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/trending/2017/03/do_oregonians_really_hate_umbr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">‚Äúreal Oregonians don‚Äôt use an umbrella‚Äù</a>. I do recommend having one though because it does pour occasionally.</p><p id=\"\">I did go once during the fall which was beautiful to see. The trees had just started to turn those lovely shades of yellow, red, and orange. üçÅ There were piles of leaves on the ground. All I wanted to do was pick some up and toss them above my head like in the movies. </p><p id=\"\">I quickly learned that this doesn't quite work when it has just been raining. As it turns out, there could be mud hiding underneath those leaves.</p><h3 id=\"\">üå≤ Into the wilderness</h3><p id=\"\"><span id=\"\">After finishing school, I wanted to experience something new. It had been two years since my father passed away, so I also wanted to get away. </span></p><p id=\"\">I am really glad we did. Being <a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/positive-effects-of-nature/?utm_source=heyrebekah.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">surrounded by nature</a> was the best move we could have made. It helped both me and my husband get back to a good mental state. </p><p id=\"\">Shortly after moving, we got rid of our car. It turned out to be a great choice, as it encouraged us to walk more, which I absolutely love. Luckily, we were within walking distance of a lot of nice areas, including a park. In Portland, most parks feel like forests, and the one we frequented was no different. It happened to be called <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-parks-portland-oregon?utm_source=heyrebekah.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">Forest Park</a>. We went there often during the non-rainy months. </p><p id=\"\">It helped to be around different outdoor areas during the pandemic. We were outside even more during that time. We were so glad we had moved and explored the area before COVID hit. We were able to appreciate it more. </p><h3 id=\"\">üöó Baby on board</h3><p id=\"\">Once I found out I was pregnant we decided to get a car again. We stumbled upon a book called ‚Äú<a href=\"https://tenderlovingempire.com/products/50hikeswithkidsoregonandwashington?utm_source=heyrebekah.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">50 Hikes with Kids: Oregon and Washington</a>‚Äù by Wendy Gorton in a local store and were pumped to have found it. We started exploring the outer areas of the city and even ventured outside of Portland more often. Although we wished we had a car the whole time, we were happy to have saved money by not having one. </p><p id=\"\">While I miss the Pacific Northwest, our new chapter began when our son was born.

We‚Äôre trying to decide between Crater Lake and Sequoia National Park. Originally, we had planned a trip to go see Crater Lake, but that changed when we found our house.

We‚Äôve decided to try and make a trip to Sequoia this year, so that should be fun. <br></li></ol>",

They've published about 75 articles using this method and they claim:</p><blockquote id=\"\">Not a single reader has noticed!</blockquote><p id=\"\">What's odd about this is how far they've gone to explain their thinking in reaction to the story hitting the news cycle.

As most of you know, we decided to send the newsletter from our fancy new domain. This meant we‚Äôd have to warm up IP addresses and establish our sender reputation on the interwebs. </p><p id=\"\">This is a process that takes months. </p><p id=\"\">We figured we‚Äôd use this time to run experiments, gather data, and develop a content catalog. Then we‚Äôd introduce Hey Rebekah to our community of over 300,000 digital marketers and self-employed knowledge workers.</p><p id=\"\">We didn‚Äôt anticipate the curiosity of many community members who may have noticed subtle changes to our social profiles. Or when Ambreen made 47 back-to-back edits filling up everyone‚Äôs feed.</p><h3 id=\"\">A little sooner than expected</h3><p id=\"\">Our closed-loop test group has grown by over 50% with your referrals and organic sign-ups. We can‚Äôt thank you enough for your support.</p><p id=\"\">We‚Äôve also had an incredible amount of interest in our Partner Program. We‚Äôve been reaching out to companies that make the tools we use, requesting a discount for our readers instead of an affiliate commission for us. Our efforts have been met with them all saying Yaaasssss!</p><p id=\"\">It‚Äôs also been mind-blowing to receive interest from potential sponsors so early. We‚Äôve had to put a pin in that interest because we‚Äôre not ready yet. The good news is, we will be. </p><h3 id=\"\">OK, but now what</h3><p id=\"\">The two most essential experiments we‚Äôre conducting right now are related to sending time and spray and pray vs. personalization. Because of system limitations, optimizing the newsletter‚Äôs send time is on hold. </p><p id=\"\">Our data indicate that readers engage with Hey Rebekah the most when it arrives while sipping their morning coffee. So we‚Äôre figuring out a solution for 24 global time zones while ensuring we can get some sleep.</p><h3 id=\"\">For our next act</h3><p id=\"\">When we started writing, we were sure we‚Äôd need the ability to personalize content based on our readers‚Äô preferences. Right now, that‚Äôs our highest priority before we open up the newsletter. </p><p id=\"\">Over the next two weeks, we‚Äôll be changing outfits backstage and getting organized to:</p><ol start=\"1\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Update our content catalog</li><li id=\"\">Invite readers to indicate their topic preferences</li><li id=\"\">Update systems to enable personalization</li></ol><h3 id=\"\">Wait, but‚Ä¶</h3><p id=\"\">Don‚Äôt worry! We‚Äôll still glow up your inboxes daily during the transition. The format will be a little different, so we can focus on getting ready for the big public reveal.</p><p id=\"\">In the meantime, if you‚Äôve got any great ideas we can <a href=\"https://heyrebekah.com/gists/start-no-code-ecommerce-site-printful-shopify?utm_source=heyrebekah.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gist_20230213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">steal like an artist</a> or have any questions, don‚Äôt hesitate and slide into our inbox.<a href=\"https://collabfund.com/blog/the-art-and-science-of-spending-money/?utm_source=heyrebekah.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"></a><br></p>",

He spent countless hours at the office. It was pure luxury. Floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views of Victoria Harbor and cool grey carpeting so gritty it could exfoliate your feet. </p><p id=\"\">The height of the cubicle walls was just right, forcing Sam to squeeze in an occasional half-squat when hollering at a colleague. The restrooms? Next level, complete with awkward shoulder rubbing attendants and fluffy hand towels. I see you‚Äôre thinking about that last one, I said it was awkward didn‚Äôt I?</p><h3 id=\"\">Seagulls in formation</h3><p id=\"\">Most of the walls in the office were adorned with carefully curated messages from Successories. They‚Äôre like framed memes for the office, but cheesier.</p><p id=\"\">Sam must have memorized every one of the inspirational quotes. Yet amongst all the cringe, it was often the words of an Austrian-American management philosopher that did resonate with him. You probably know them well too:</p><blockquote id=\"\">Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Don‚Äôt race to the bottom</h3><p id=\"\">This was a confounding principle that took Sam some time to understand. Ironically, it finally hit home a few years later when his team was literally laughed out of a pitch by one those game-changing client opportunities.</p><p id=\"\">Notwithstanding the anger they felt, they held their heads high and marked the opportunity as lost rather than chasing it further.</p><h3 id=\"\">Walking from a mocking</h3><p id=\"\">Turning away from a massive, multi-year-target crushing prospect was the right thing to do. Some of Sam's colleagues didn‚Äôt agree at first and his bank account sure as $#!t didn‚Äôt like the idea either. However, it became clear to them that the prospect didn‚Äôt value their expertise or capabilities. </p><p id=\"\">They wore this decision as a badge of honor and moved on. </p><p id=\"\">But before the team left that day, the stubborn and petulant scrapper in Sam couldn‚Äôt help but clapback to the questioning of their fees with:</p><h3 id=\"\">Creating spaces</h3><p id=\"\">As self-employed professionals, it can be tempting to say yes to every project that comes your way. After all, bills need to be paid and the fridge needs beer. </p><p id=\"\">But sometimes, saying yes to every project can lead to a never-ending cycle of regret, exhaustion, and resentment. Especially when you‚Äôve had to devalue yourself by discounting your fees to land the gig.</p><p id=\"\">Don't be afraid to say no to the opportunities that don't light your fire. Walk away from clients who don‚Äôt value your work. </p><p id=\"\">Doing the right thing‚Äîeven when it‚Äôs hard‚Äîwill open up space for a business filled with work that you'll be proud of. </p><p id=\"\">The kind that will make you feel fulfilled, at the top of your game, and keep you smiling all the way to the bank. And there are no discounts to your work necessary.</p>",

The best practices are laser-etched into my brain. The good thing is agile doesn‚Äôt just apply to software. You can steal productivity hacks from agile development methodology. Here's how I do it:</p><p id=\"\">I align expectations by estimating the effort right on the task. I play a game of hybrid poker planning every Monday. I use a simple 1 to 5 scoring method representing hours. üÉè</p><p id=\"\">Anything above a 5 needs to be broken down further. </p><p id=\"\">With most of my tasks estimated, I can get a quick birds eye view of when I‚Äôm overloaded. I usually have 177 hours of effort that has to get done by tomorrow, because Ambreen says so. </p><p id=\"\">Sound familiar?</p><h3 id=\"\">Quality and iteration FTW</h3><p id=\"\">I use due dates as a guideline for priority. If there‚Äôs a hard deadline, then of course I‚Äôll treat it as such. But that‚Äôs when another important discussion happens. I ask which of the other 31 things I should sacrifice to the deadline gods. üôà</p><h3 id=\"\">It‚Äôs all in the details</h3><p id=\"\">Pay attention to the little things. What are you being asked to do? Then, go ahead and do it.</p><p id=\"\">When you‚Äôre done, double check your work. Remember like we used to do in 4th grade algebra? Revisit the scope to make sure you haven‚Äôt missed anything. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I overlooked something because I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. Finally, before I mark it complete, I make sure I love it! </p><p id=\"\">Otherwise, what‚Äôs the point?</p><h3 id=\"\">Time equals power</h3><p id=\"\">When it comes to doing high quality work, time is your best friend. The pursuit of excellence is not a sprint, it‚Äôs a marathon.</p><p id=\"\">The more time you give to your work, the more power it will have. This is a hard balancing act to master and an ongoing struggle because our creative lead wants what she wants when she wants it. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p id=\"\">For me, it‚Äôs one of the most important skills to focus on. This goes hand-in-hand with effective communication. </p><p id=\"\">We have a natural desire to please people. Fight the urge. Remember to underpromise as a service. You‚Äôll end up pleasing your client and yourself in a more predictable way.</p><h3 id=\"\">Mediocrity is always in a rush</h3><p id=\"\">Be careful of the busy vs. productive illusion. There‚Äôs a difference between checking things off a list vs. getting the right things done, right. </p><p id=\"\">Avoid mediocrity like someone sneezing in an elevator.</p><h3 id=\"\">Genius is just doing things well</h3><p id=\"\">Genius is not about being born with a magic wand. It's about taking the time to do something to the best of your ability. Even the simplest task, if done well, can be a work of genius.</p><p id=\"\">So there you have it, a peek into my agile development-inspired productivity habits.

You served us well, but it‚Äôs time to move on. </p><p id=\"\">Yes, we've traded in our comfortable, worn-out sneakers for some shiny new high-tops. We decided on a task management upgrade. And <a href=\"https://height.app?utm_source=heyrebekah.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">Height App</a> is making it happen.</p><p id=\"\">So how did we come to side with the newcomer in the Height vs. Asana match?</p><p id=\"\">Height is as if Asana, Notion, and Google Sheets had a task management love child. It‚Äôs a delightful experience and a refreshing simplification to Asana‚Äôs clunkiness.</p><p id=\"\">Our biggest complaint with Asana is that they failed to adopt or adapt to evolving user expectations. Since <a href=\"https://www.lennyspodcast.com/how-notion-leveraged-community-to-build-a-10b-business-camille-ricketts-notion-first-round-capital/?utm_source=heyrebekah.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">Notion took over the world</a>, users call for effective simplicity.

And with Height, we‚Äôre putting on our stretchy pants. </p><h3 id=\"\">En$#!ttification of Platforms</h3><p id=\"\">Since they went public, we began to notice a lot of changes in Asana we weren‚Äôt fans of. The way new features were introduced, upgrade notices, and their seat pricing. It made us‚Äîas loyal, longtime paying users‚Äîfeel second fiddle to the needs of Wall Street.</p><p id=\"\">Cory Doctorow aptly describes this as, <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys?utm_source=heyrebekah.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">en$#!ttification</a>:</p><blockquote id=\"\">Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Migrating in minutes</h3><p id=\"\">Height made jumping the ship super easy. After setting up the workspace, we used their built-in Asana integration to import tasks to newly created lists in Height. </p><p id=\"\">It took us about an hour to complete the imports in the background. Then under an hour to get <a href=\"https://heyrebekah.com/tools/height?utm_source=heyrebekah?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gist_20230130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" id=\"\">organized in Height</a>.

One of them was to create our official editorial policy. If you're crazy enough to launch your own newsletter or other publication online, you need one too.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong>ü§ñThe Gist by ChatGPT:</strong>&nbsp;Editorial policy is a set of guidelines and principles that are used to govern the content published within an organization. It sets standards for accuracy and quality, as well as guidelines for topics, language, and tone. It also sets standards for ethical reporting, including guidelines for conflicts of interest, privacy, and fairness. The editorial policy also sets out procedures for handling complaints and corrections to published content.</p><h3 id=\"\">The \"Why\"</h3><p id=\"\">It gives our readers a transparent view of how we choose what to write about. Our partners and sponsors can use it as a clear starting point when interested in collaborating with us. And it helps explain where we stand to job candidates and the press. Everybody wins.</p><p id=\"\">But before you start hyperventilating about the process, here's our playbook on how we did it.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">The Inspiration</h3><p id=\"\">We're not going to pretend that everything cool we come up with has been brought to us by a stroke of divine genius. We have creative minds that need inspiration. And this time it came from&nbsp;this enviable <a href=\"https://gettheelevator.com/editorial?utm_source=heyrebekah?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gist_20230126\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Editorial Policy</a> by Elevator. We read it and immediately thought: that's some good good $#!t!</p><h3 id=\"\">The Juice&nbsp;</h3><p id=\"\">That‚Äîtogether with single-origin Kenyan coffee‚Äîgot Susan's creative juices flowing. She took the main idea from Elevator and inserted our personality, values, process, and mission. She added a bit about affiliate links and how we plan to work with sponsors.</p><h3 id=\"\">The Scrutiny</h3><p id=\"\">The first draft was scrutinized by our merciless editorial squad. Because, the work gets better with every new pair of eyeballs.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">We ran it through <a href=\"https://hemingwayapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hemingway App</a>‚Äîwhich told Susan she was trying to sound too clever #StoryOfHerLife. To solve the issue, we cut the clever until the readability score clocked in at Grade 5. Then we improved the flow while making sure that the edits preserved the initial juice. Dayyum! <br><br>Finally, when we all agreed that we \"love it\", we were ready to rock. </p><h3 id=\"\">More Eyeballs</h3><p id=\"\">We uploaded the final‚Äìfinal version&nbsp;to our internal documentation system and announced what we've been up to in Slack. It keeps everyone in the loop. Then, in line with our idealistic commitment to sharing knowledge, we gave you the whole process here. Lucky you!</p><h3 id=\"\">The Result</h3><p id=\"\">We put a link to this editorial policy on our website and newsletter footers. <a href=\"https://heyrebekah.com/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Check it out here.</a>&nbsp;Then reply and let us know what you think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

The dependency was often a bottleneck to growth.<br></p><p id=\"\">Hey Rebekah‚Äîa tech-enabled startup‚Äîis built with mostly <a href=\"https://heyrebekah.com/built-with?utm_source=heyrebekah?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gist_20230123\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">no code systems</a>. That was a conscious choice we made after assessing our internal resources. We wanted to ensure that the bulk of the team could do the things they needed to without being at the mercy of our grumpy technical resources.</p><h3 id=\"\">Reducing reader acquisition costs</h3><p id=\"\">It's no secret that word-of-mouth marketing is the holy grail of acquisition. So our growth strategy revolves around WOM. We're lucky because we have an existing community of over 300,000 who are huge fans of Rebekah.</p><p id=\"\">Then, there's new acquisition. By default, we know we're going to run ads soon. Typically, just the ad-spend CAC for Instagram or Facebook will range from $1.50-$2.50 per conversion. Anywhere between 50-75% of that outside the US.</p><p id=\"\">However, there's a huge difference in the quality of conversions between WOM and an ad-based referral. According to Nielsen, 92% of people trust recommendations. Think about it, most of you are reading Hey Rebekah today because someone you know recommended it, or Ambreen/Rebekah have guilted you into it.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1200px\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"A woman with a cool Hey Rebekah beanie cap\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/63ce95fb5ee7d710b6c8f0cf_head-warmer.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Hooked by Triggers, actions, and rewards</h3><p id=\"\">We use internal and external triggers to delight our readers everyday.

So we had to figure out costs and get some figures to estimate value. The trick here is to try and assess the value of a WOM referral in comparison to paid acquisition.

As I booted up my computer, a conversation from my early morning breakfast played over in my mind. I‚Äôd met a long-time mentor to catch up on business. </p><p id=\"\">Scooting into the seat of my favorite coffee shop, I wasn't prepared for the question she shot at me.</p><p id=\"\">‚ÄúTell me the last time you failed.\"&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">I could feel my body tense, as I seemed to melt into my seat. Then it hit me, that hot wave of shame, washing over me like that failure was yesterday.</p><p id=\"\">It all began when I purchased what was then my current company. No, there wasn‚Äôt any fanfare or long negotiations. It was simple. I stepped into the owner's office one day, and she asked, ‚Äúwhat would you think about buying the company?‚Äù </p><p id=\"\">I chuckled‚Äîwhich I‚Äôm sure included a snort‚Äîthinking she was joking. All the while, her eyes stayed fixed on mine. Holy crap, I thought, she‚Äôs serious!</p><p id=\"\">It was only a year before that I‚Äôd left my career in morning radio. Here I was, faced with the idea of leaping full force into entrepreneurship.</p><p id=\"\">A million questions ran through my mind, but instead of eloquence at that moment, I heard myself blurt out, ‚ÄúReally!?‚Äù Yep, true to today, I‚Äôve always been the one with a quick wit against tough questions.</p><p id=\"\">Speed ahead, and we‚Äôd come to terms. There I was, a newly anointed business owner, floating on cloud nine. As visions of growth and revenue goals danced in my head, the stark reality began to sink in. I had zero experience running a company.</p><p id=\"\">I‚Äôd only been out of radio for a year, and becoming an overnight entrepreneur wasn‚Äôt on my bingo card. For nearly a decade, I‚Äôd had a terrific career as one-half of the number-one morning show. But life as a single mom who gets up at 3:00 am to talk on the radio wasn‚Äôt as much fun as it might seem.</p><p id=\"\">Most mornings were spent dragging myself out of bed, wrapping my son up, and driving over to my parent's house. There he‚Äôd sleep another few hours before this heavenly angel‚Äîcalled my mother‚Äîhelped him get ready for preschool.</p><p id=\"\">I‚Äôd limp into the station, begging for that first cup of coffee, and grumble hello at my morning show partner and production team. I mean, who‚Äôs ever ready to say ‚Äúgood morning, everybody‚Äù with a wink and a smile at 4:30 am?</p><h3 id=\"\">There's strength in numbers</h3><p id=\"\">Running isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart, and definitely not for me. At least, that's what I told myself until 2021. Before that, the mere thought of running a block had me gasping for air. But let's rewind to my early days of dabbling in sports. </p><p id=\"\">I‚Äôve always been a health nut, my family can attest to my excessive enthusiasm for achieving a goal, but I was never athletic. </p><p id=\"\">I remember my early days of giving sports a go. I‚Äôd begged my parents to let me try softball, even though I‚Äôd never hit a ball. My cousin‚Äîplaying since elementary‚Äîtold me to try out for her team. </p><p id=\"\">So off I went, practicing every day in my backyard, hoping to win a spot.</p><p id=\"\">On the day of tryouts, I stepped up to the plate. The coach‚Äîencouraging me to choke up on the bat, hunker down, and wait for the ball‚Äîhad bigger expectations than I did. </p><p id=\"\">Me? I never saw any of the strikes coming. One, whoosh, two‚Ä¶whoosh, three? Pretty sure you know how that ended.</p><p id=\"\">What I didn‚Äôt expect was the resolve it gave me. The desire to see something through, to give it my best shot, and to know that I‚Äôd done all I could to finish the race.</p><p id=\"\">Maybe that‚Äôs what led me to take up running. Maybe it made me fall in love with such a god-forsaken sport. Maybe it made me dig in every day, find my groove, and give it everything I had. </p><p id=\"\">Looking back, though, it‚Äôs a funny thing. It was never about softball or even running. It was about being my best. Finding the strength within me to push through no matter what and to know that even on the darkest days, the ones running the race beside me make it all worthwhile.</p><p id=\"\">That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, continuing to run a race after almost twenty-five years of self-employment. But this time, I‚Äôm doing it with the most amazing crew anyone could ask for.<br></p>",

What the heck is Hey Rebekah and what are you doing? </p><p id=\"\">If you haven't skimmed that drop yet üëÜüèº, now may be a good time to get the gist üëáüèº.</p><p id=\"\">ü§ñ <strong>The gist by ChatGPT:</strong>&nbsp;We've been in the digital marketing space for a while now, helping companies gain superpowers. But when we took on a new client in 2020, we realized that our business model was not scalable. So we did some research and broke things down to first principles to discover a new value proposition different than what we thought it was, focusing on our success as self-employed professionals. ü§Ø</p><h3 id=\"\">What we're good at x What we love</h3><p id=\"\">Once we understood what we were good at, we shifted our attention to what we love. Given our recent client experience, doing meaningful work at scale was something that was important to us. </p><p id=\"\">But first, so we're all on the same page, let's summarize what we're good at. Our planning started with an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101RCmPXSph55hVVbDDuaSLLOPkLdOdRPxmRWhYw-DfA/edit#gid=1122274426\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">endless list</a> of specific topics we've excelled at. Hey, look, we're flexing! üòá</p><p id=\"\">That grueling exercise‚Äîsomehow made even more mysterious by hidden columns to be revealed later‚Äîproved to be a real eye opener for the things we do‚Äîthat we're good at. But it didn't necessarily explain who we are. So we <a href=\"https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/?utm_source=heyrebekah?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gist_20230119\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">modified</a> our thinking and landed on: </p><p id=\"\">We're successful self-employed professionals who are good at X.</p><p id=\"\">Remember those stories of colleagues we shared? Well, that's basically what we love. After another few days of wiping the crappy dry-erase ink off our hands from white-boarding, we determined:</p><p id=\"\">We're successful self-employed professionals who are good at X who love helping people become&nbsp;successful self-employed professionals who are good at X.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1200px\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"An illustration of nervous woman with her hands under her chin staring at some numbers\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/63c94daa74eeaa4baa69ba68_frida-scale.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">A nervous woman with her hands under her chin staring at some numbers in the style of Frida Kahlo | Hugging Face by Stable Diffusion 2.1</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"\">Hah, but will it scale?</h3><p id=\"\">The hardest part was now past us, or so we thought. Next, we had to gather some benchmarks on scalability. We didn't want to run into the same plateau we met earlier. So it was time for some sodium, coding, methodic research, and melodiIc background noise. </p><p id=\"\">Hey reader #177,306! Give us a minute, we're almost done, promise.</p><p id=\"\">We started by exploring the Total Addressable Market which indicates the maximum opportunity size we could theoretically address. Here's a snapshot of those findings based on 2019 data from the <a href=\"https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/?utm_source=heyrebekah?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gist_20230119\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">ILO</a> and World Bank:</p><ul type=\"disc\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">There's roughly 3.3 billion full-time working professionals globally</li><li id=\"\">With a CAGR of 15.3%</li><li id=\"\">Of which 49% identify as self-employed</li><li id=\"\">1,617,000,000 seemed super high, so we cut it in half üî™</li><li id=\"\">808,500,000 was still incomprehensible to us, so we chopped it in two again üó°Ô∏è</li><li id=\"\">404,250,000 self-employed professionals globally, a number we could live with</li></ul><p id=\"\">So this initial exercise produced one component of our TAM that was brain-numbing, even after slashing the figures down to numbers we could pronounce. We now had some initial validation that achieving scale was possible. More <a href=\"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/freelance-stats?utm_source=heyrebekah?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gist_20230119\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">up-to-date analysis</a> by the smart people at Exploding Topics reinforced our own.</p><p id=\"\">Alright, we know how captivated you are by all of this and hate to burst your bubble, but we're going to continue the adventure on Tuesday in part 3.</p>",

Haris had an affinity for technology fueled by his passion for gaming. To many a mother's dismay, he hung out a lot at local gaming centers playing Counter Strike.</p><p id=\"\">Of course, what would gaming be without the ability to roast your buddies? Haris joined a gaming forum to communicate and collaborate with his fellow strikers. It was there that he noticed that it had a section for design. He decided to learn how to create in-demand forum signatures that made your profile look cool. He made one for himself and a few for friends.</p><p id=\"\">Creating spurred his desire for more. Haris always wanted to build a website to \"show his friends and impress his teachers\". So that's exactly what he did.</p><p id=\"\">After a few tries, he found a way to monetize one of them for $100 with AdSense. That was a pivotal moment in his career. It gave him the validation he needed to overcome his family's apprehensions about the time he spent at his computer.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Took a few blows then landed a knockout</h3><p id=\"\">He was introduced to WordPress by a theme creator he was working with and fell in love. Haris refined his development chops working with various theme developers then decided to create his own.</p><p id=\"\">At first, it didn't go as planned. His submission was rejected more than 10x by ThemeForest and he was devastated. He almost gave up, but then put his head down and kept going. We're glad he did!</p><blockquote id=\"\"> This was a good lesson for me; don‚Äôt give up and learn from the failures. Learning from failures is important. <br><br>Muhammad Haris Zulfiqar</blockquote><p id=\"\">Instead of a freelancing platform, Haris took the bold step of establishing direct contacts with design agencies. It's an approach that eventually paid off, big time.</p><h3 id=\"\">Tampa x Lahore</h3><p id=\"\">Haris went on to connect with Luke Beck, a designer from Florida. Luke had some success selling his WordPress themes on Envato and was interested in finding a reliable development partner.</p><p id=\"\">They launched a couple of themes together with mixed results. Then, they went back to the drawing board to shake things up. Although their themes would ultimately benefit the companies' whose sites were published, they realized that the people building the sites were at the nucleus of their future.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Understanding this underserved market with unmet needs provided them with laser focus to create a killer product. One that was optimized to the way WordPress developers and users worked. Their product provided greater versatility, improved usability, and infinite extensibility.</p><h3 id=\"\">A star was born</h3><p id=\"\">Luke and Haris launched Avada. It's the <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226/?utm_source=heyrebekah\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">top selling premium WordPress theme</a> on the planet. With almost 866,000 sales, it's estimated that Avada powers over 4% of the internet's websites.

      "content": "<h2 id=\"\">Hey Rebekah, what's the plan!?</h2><p id=\"\">As we near the half way mark of warming up our email sender domain, we're getting a lot of questions from readers. A recurring theme: What the heck is Hey Rebekah and what are you doing? </p><p id=\"\">To be honest, we're still trying to figure it out ourselves. But don't worry, we've got some pretty solid assumptions and a dependable data-pipeline to work from. So, how did we end up here? Let's just say it involved some unique experiences, a taste of the possibilities, and a pinch of pure madness. We'll be telling you all about in painstaking detail over the coming weeks, so don't lose any sleep. üòú</p><p id=\"\">It all started mid 2020, just after taking on a new client. We were faced with the hard reality that highly personalized professional services weren't scalable and our business model was approaching it's peak. Something would have to change.</p><h3 id=\"\">Some ODIous research</h3><p id=\"\">We've played in the digital marketing space for as long as we can remember. Rebekah's been one of the <a href=\"https://browsermedia.agency/blog/top-100-digital-marketing-influencers-2022/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">most sought after</a>&nbsp;experts since forever, Ambreen the creative force, and Sam powering the tech. We've been helping companies gain digital marketing superpowers together, since 2014.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">So it was logical and convenient that our focus remain in the field moving forward. We examined the landscape to identify problems companies were facing, did some competitive benchmarking, and identified a lot of possibilities.</p><p id=\"\">However, something occurred to us as we continued to conduct a <a href=\"https://strategyn.com/outcome-driven-innovation-process/?utm_source=heyrebekah\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">unique combination</a> of qualitative and quantitative research in our market segmentation.</p><h3 id=\"\">First things first</h3><p id=\"\">When examining our value proposition and what we've achieved together we honed in on stuff like:</p><ul type=\"disc\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">65 years of combined experience</li><li id=\"\">Acquired 315M users</li><li id=\"\">Converted 100M users to customers</li><li id=\"\">Earned over $10M</li></ul><p id=\"\">But we overlooked the fact that we were self-employed professionals. When we <a href=\"https://heyrebekah.com/gists/what-is-first-principles-thinking\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">focused on that basic&nbsp;premise</a>, everything changed. It was at that point that our unique value proposition became clearer.</p><p id=\"\">Oh, and remember that client we talked about from 2020? We were introduced to them by our favorite person who'd taken on a senior role there. It was a non-profit organization working to make higher education more accessible.</p><p id=\"\">Our time there had a huge impact on our path forward. It redefined meaningful work for us. So we reframed our thinking and began to look at things in a new way.</p><p id=\"\">What has made us successful self-employed professionals and how could we leverage that to help others?</p><h3 id=\"\">A discovery</h3><p id=\"\">Approaching the question from a new paradigm landed us on something unexpected. What made us successful as digital marketing professionals was deeply seeded in what made us successful as self-employed professionals:</p><ul type=\"disc\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Significant exposure to enterprise/best-practices</li><li id=\"\">A lot of insider knowledge gained from experience</li><li id=\"\">A deep understanding of business processes</li><li id=\"\">A superior command of business technologies</li><li id=\"\">An established network of contacts</li><li id=\"\">A ton of hard work</li><li id=\"\">A $#!t load of mistakes</li><li id=\"\">Probably a little luck too</li></ul><p id=\"\">It was about this time that we were contacted by a former colleague who was with us on one of our client adventures. They had written to check-in, say hello, and to let us know that they'd been promoted to the role of Engineering Manager at Meta.</p><p id=\"\">What stood out about this story was their gratitude for things they said we helped them with or showed them during our time together. For some reason, they over estimated those simple things in lieu of their own potential and capabilities. We reminded them of that and were grateful for the check-in nevertheless.</p><p id=\"\">That quick thread made us reflect upon some of the other people we worked with, many that had similar trajectories. Most of whom continue to remain self-employed. Where were they now?</p><p id=\"\">There's the story of our former social media manager from Cebu who went on the productize her service offerings and establish a thriving agency.</p><p id=\"\">There's also our ASP.net friend from Kharkiv who built one of the first Facebook payment apps with us. They now run a team of .net professionals working with big US companies on Azure. We're thinking about you K, stay safe!</p><p id=\"\">There are a lot more of these stories and we'll share them with you in detail in future editions. However, what's curious about each of them is the profound effect of exposing high-potential, self-employed professionals to the factors that have contributed to our own career success, such as best practices, industry expertise, and business processes.</p><p id=\"\">Ultimately, the path forward became clear. We were going to help self-employed professionals become better at what they do so that they can make more money and find their joy. How? We'll get to that in the next part of this story.</p><p id=\"\">This&nbsp;is the first part of a multi-part series that we'll be continuing on Tuesdays and Thursdays until we're done boring you to death.<br></p>",

      "content": "<h2 id=\"\">Incredible LTV</h2><p id=\"\">This story was told to me by my husband Sam, who you may occasionally see drifting around making things blink and buzz on the backend of Hey Rebekah.</p><p id=\"\">Growing up is like a rollercoaster ride. We start off as cute little babies, learn a bunch of cool stuff at school, and boom‚Äîadulthood hits us like a ton of bricks. </p><p id=\"\">Adulting comes out of nowhere. Paying taxes, working 9-to-5, and being responsible. He's had it good compared to so many and he don't take that for granted. </p><p id=\"\">But that doesn't mean it's been a cakewalk.</p><p id=\"\">For example, nobody warned Sam that being a grown-up doesn't come with a happiness guarantee. Or that having a job doesn't automatically mean rolling in dough.</p><h3 id=\"\">First flight out</h3><p id=\"\">Right after college, Sam headed out to the Far East to start a career with a big management consulting firm. It was everything he'd been striving for:</p><ul type=\"disc\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Good company ‚úÖ</li><li id=\"\">Challenge ‚úÖ</li><li id=\"\">Decent pay ‚úÖ</li><li id=\"\">Opportunity for advancement ‚úÖ</li><li id=\"\">World travel ‚úÖ</li><li id=\"\">Independence ‚úÖ</li><li id=\"\">Cheap beer ‚úÖ</li><li id=\"\">Good food ‚úÖ</li></ul><p id=\"\">His parents were proud, his sister was delighted she finally got space to expand her empire at home, and Sam was kind of pumped. Over the course of the next year, he put my head down and hustled.</p><p id=\"\">Sam was off to a good start. From a base in Hong Kong, he'd traveled to Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Vietnam. Next year, off to visit clients in China, India, the Middle East, and Africa. </p><p id=\"\">As a systems analyst, his work was repetitive but challenging. Sam was learning new things daily and getting better at it.</p><h3 id=\"\">Ruthless routines</h3><p id=\"\">Sam traveled home a couple times his first year. It was always great. However, after his second trip, Sam realized what a toll the 20 hour journey to the past‚Äîthen back to the future‚Äîwas taking.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The next year, Sam was more engrossed in work than before. His responsibilities were increasing and colleagues were depending on him. Sam used this as an excuse to skip the first planned trip home because he couldn't afford the downtime.</p><p id=\"\">Strangely, it was about this time that he noticed that he was feeling burned out by the ruthless routine at work. It probably played a part in Sam's decision to skip the first trip home without realizing it.</p><h3 id=\"\">Not home for the holidays</h3><p id=\"\">Around late September that year,&nbsp; Sam was on what was almost a daily phone call with his folks before he left the office. A few other colleagues‚Äîincluding his boss Doug‚Äîfrom the US often hung around and did the same. The company Sam worked for had a direct patch to the US and gave access to free calls.</p><p id=\"\">That night, Doug overheard what must have been a louder conversation than usual. Sam was telling his mom that he probably wouldn't be coming home for dad's birthday and Thanksgiving. That didn't sit well with her of course and she was concerned to say the least.</p><p id=\"\">Doug perfectly timed his departure to coincide with Sam's. He neatly stacked some loose papers on his desk, straightened out a pen or two and grabbed his stuff. Sam was a little embarrassed by the louder moments of the call and wondered if Doug had noticed.</p><p id=\"\">He had. But his reaction was not what Sam expected. In fact, that brief chat with him had a profound impact on Sam's life and changed it forever.</p><h3 id=\"\">The most important customers</h3><p id=\"\">After some casual banter, Doug asked if everything was alright. He was concerned. First he talked about work and how interacting with clients and colleagues. He framed the discussion in a way that was very relatable.</p><p id=\"\">He had observed the professional approach Sam had developed while dealing with clients. It was often tough because of the complex and technical nature of their work. He then highlighted a particularly difficult client example and asked Sam to explore why and how he managed to maintain composure in that situation. </p><p id=\"\">They had a livid client, the client was pretty transparent about it, and the whole engagement was on the line. Sam was a member of the team it got dumped-on to fix.</p><p id=\"\">Then Doug subtly let the conversation he overheard with Sam's parents slide in to the awakening. He started by empathizing with the challenges of being away from home. Then he helped Sam realize that it wasn't just him facing the challenge. It was also the people at home. The people who love us. The people who's community we're a part of.</p><p id=\"\">Doug shared a piece of advice that Sam never forget. He said something like:</p><blockquote id=\"\">Life is kind of funny. At work, we're faced with tough colleagues and impossible clients. Yet, we usually find a way to maintain composure and cope with the situation. <br><br>Why? Probably because we're in work mode, get paid, and there's a general expectation that the client is always right. No matter what, we never cross a line.<br><br>Yet, in our personal lives we often neglect people who love us, in the name of work. We're impatient, less tolerant, and dismissive. We cancel plans easily, we're late, we don't follow up. Stuff that we'd never do at work.<br><br>What if we treated them the same way we treat our clients?<br><br>What if we treated the people who love us as the most important clients in our lives? &nbsp;</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">A fresh perspective</h3><p id=\"\">This was Sam's first real introduction to the difference between urgent vs. important. After which, he rarely missed a meeting with his parents. Following up routinely with his sister and friends became clockwork. Sam was present when they were together.</p><p id=\"\">He was more empathetic when they were livid and sought reasonable solutions. And finally, Sam was more understanding with his community of loved ones, including when he learned that his mom had been calling his boss on a weekly basis to check in on Sam. ü§¶üèΩ</p><p id=\"\">Sam has learned that at work, keeping clients happy leads to better business outcomes. Keeping his community happy in his personal life‚Äîusing the skills he applies everyday professionally‚Äîleads to better personal outcomes.<br></p>",

Yes, you read that right.</p><p id=\"\">The demand for social media ghostwriters has surged in the last year, especially on business-oriented platforms like LinkedIn. As execs work to create their visibility on social channels, social media ghostwriters are able to capitalize, some raising rates as much as 40%.</p><p id=\"\">What's especially interesting about this case though, is that they're doing it for VCs. They've made a $100,000 for a thread announcing a big round of funding and also earn between $5,000-$10,000 a month for 10 original tweets. ü§Ø</p><p id=\"\">They usually have up to 50 clients at a time and have invested in a system to manage their side-hustle. They keep track of opportunities in a CRM, have a dedicated computer, phone, and email account.</p><p id=\"\">On average, they spend 5 hours a week running their side hustle.</p><h3 id=\"\">A validating push</h3><p id=\"\">Our ghost tweeter didn't know anything about ghostwriting beforehand. As a principal in the VC industry they developed a cynical, tongue-in-cheek, public Twitter persona for their job. The funny thing is, after a while, the DMs started pouring in.</p><p id=\"\">At first it felt shady, like sneaking candy into a movie theater. DMs used coded language as not to reveal the clandestine nature of an illicit transaction. üòÖ</p><p id=\"\">And that's how their journey as a professional, side-hustling ghost tweeter began.</p><blockquote id=\"\"> I'm interested in having some help growing my Twitter brand. You seem really good at this. Would you have time to give me some advice? </blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Knowing their customer</h3><p id=\"\">As an insider to the VC industry, they have a deep understanding of:</p><ol type=\"decimal\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Where the industry's coming from</li><li id=\"\">Where it is now</li><li id=\"\">Where it's going</li></ol><p id=\"\">In the past, venture capitalists took forever to fund deals with a book of $10-$15 million a year across a handful of startups. They'd hope for a lifetime return of $100 million. Then unicorns like Uber happened and a few VCs made billions‚Äîsimultaneously, from the same IPO. Let the feast begin.</p><p id=\"\">The VCs, with pockets full of money, wanted more. Competition was fierce at the country club. The stakes rose higher, deals grew larger, and the best deals closed quickly, sometimes in just a day.</p><h3 id=\"\">Carving out their niche with FOMO</h3><p id=\"\">They honed in on an underserved market of venture capitalists and founders. Then mapped it to unmet needs. Helping funders build \"parasocial relationships\" on Twitter with founders.</p><p id=\"\">So basically, they're tweeting important fundraising/announcements for VCs with a voice that relates to startup founders. Smaller VCs who need reach pay a premium. Their tweets for VCs can get as many as 4 million impressions. üëÄ</p><blockquote id=\"\"> I'm writing the content that will get the attention of young founders, to establish the credibility of my clients, the VCs. </blockquote><p id=\"\">We love stories like this where smart folks double down on what they know and find something they love.

      "post-summary": "Wow your clients with a straightforward project cost estimation workflow, fresh from our own client work files. ",
      "content": "<h2 id=\"\">Project cost estimation and onboarding playbook</h2><p id=\"\"><span id=\"\"> </span>Pricing and estimation are amongst the topics we get asked about the most. A few weeks ago, we shared our thinking on <a href=\"https://heyrebekah.com/gists/can-canva-be-used-for-advertising?utm_source=email&utm_medium=gist&utm_campaign=011123\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">upcoming rate increases</a>. Today, we're giving you a peek into our upcoming client onboarding playbook.</p><blockquote id=\"\"> Hey Rebekah, how do you estimate client jobs!? &nbsp;</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Simple qualification</h3><p id=\"\">A consistent takeaway from successful self-employed professionals is the importance of a solid onboarding process. In this context, we're using onboarding as jargon for the sales lifecycle. Our typical client onboarding process goes something like this:</p><ol type=\"decimal\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Call 1: Understand the situation and qualify</li><li id=\"\">Call 2: Explore the situation further, understand problems, and uncover needs</li><li id=\"\">Homework: Research and collaboration on our end to map a solution</li><li id=\"\">Call 3: Recommendation</li></ol><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SPIN-Selling-Neil-Rackham/dp/0070511136\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Sound familiar?</a>&nbsp;100% of our legacy business comes from repeat clients and referrals, so we have a pretty high conversion rate. Nevertheless, we adjust the amount of time we invest in this business development stage, depending on the scope of the engagement.</p><h3 id=\"\">Nailing the initial discovery</h3><p id=\"\">To elaborate a bit on the second, longer discovery call, we use it as a time to get to know the prospect's business. Our goal for this session is to figure out:</p><ol type=\"decimal\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Where are they coming from?</li><li id=\"\">Where are they now?</li><li id=\"\">Where do they want to go and why?</li></ol><p id=\"\">It's easier said than done, but our focus during this call is to better understand their motivations so we can get to the real task at hand. </p><h3 id=\"\">What are they trying to become</h3><p id=\"\">This can be some heavy stuff so we're not going to dwell on it too much.</p><p id=\"\">Think of a company selling drills. Now think about the consumer who buys their product. Imagine you had a chance to ask the consumer:</p><ul type=\"disc\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Q: Why'd you buy TorqueCo's ¬º\" drill?</li><li id=\"\">A: Because I need a bunch of ¬º\" holes</li><li id=\"\">Q: OK, and why do you need a bunch of ¬º\" holes?</li><li id=\"\">A: To install my ¬º\" hooks</li><li id=\"\">Q: What do you need ¬º\" hooks for?</li><li id=\"\">A: To hang up a bunch of jackets...because I'm building a mud room</li></ul><p id=\"\">We won't bore you with more questions but the gist is: The consumer bought the&nbsp;¬º\" drill to help them get organized. That's what they're trying to become.</p><p id=\"\">We don't end our discovery unless we have a solid understanding of what our client is trying to become. By nailing this down, it gives a truer picture of where they want to go. It also helps us better identify the ways we can help them get there.</p><h3 id=\"\">Crunching the numbers</h3><p id=\"\">Our service offerings for our legacy business are repeatable and standardized packages of digital marketing superpowers. Over time, by performing these services we have a clear picture of the resources, effort, and risks/unknowns involved. </p><p id=\"\">We use these inputs to lay out pricing in an old-school way that works for us. We created pricing templates in Google Sheets that we make a copy of, then adapt them for prospective clients.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q_yRdO3MnyuKGqBRu4OAdipzOoNS-cjD0FxYAuTPTBc/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Here's a real example</a>&nbsp;for our Blueprint service. The prospect is trying to become more impactful. Where they want to go? They want to be the most sought-after life/performance coach on the planet.</p><ul type=\"disc\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Deliverable: We break down each section of the larger deliverable by Resource/lead. It makes it easier to talk about and be transparent</li><li id=\"\">Resource: This is the person running the effort</li><li id=\"\">Estimate: This is the actual time the Resource has estimated to complete the effort</li><li id=\"\">Contingency: This is a default % to be added to the Estimate (in hours) based on the risks/unknowns. It makes or breaks profitability so be careful</li><li id=\"\">Effort: Sum of the Estimate + Contingency</li><li id=\"\">Rate: The hourly price we charge for the Resource</li><li id=\"\">Fee: Sum of the hourly Rate x Effort.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Here's a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7w8nr60cxkvq0c3/prospect%2Bbril.la.pdf?dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">copy of the slides</a> we used in our recommendation session to the prospect. Upon verbal acceptance, we dumped this information into a <a href=\"https://heyrebekah.com/tools/harvest?utm_source=email&utm_medium=gist&utm_campaign=011123\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Harvest Estimate</a> and got it formally approved, followed by our contract.</p><p id=\"\">That's it! Whew...it really seems a lot more complicated than it is. We hope you'll be able to take your project cost estimation to a new level with this peek into our playbook.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">In the weeks to come, we'll be diving much deeper into each of these topics. Until then, holler if you have any questions or follow ups.<br></p>",
