Read through their bio to determine whether or not you share common interests.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Follow people that your influencers follow. Again, check their bio to determine if there is a fit or not. &nbsp;Staying focused on your niche will make it easy for you to build a community centered around similar interests.</li></ol><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;3. Use Twitter Lists</h2><p id=\"\">Twitter lists are a way to group users together by some common thread. For example, you might create a list of people who tweet about a topic that you want to follow on a daily basis, such as social media.</p><p id=\"\">The idea is to make these tweets easily accessible. This allows you to keep up with certain people without the hassle of searching for them every time.</p><p id=\"\">How should you use Twitter lists to keep yourself active and invested in important conversations?</p><h3 id=\"\">How to Use Twitter Lists</h3><p id=\"\">Create a list of:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">People from an event you attended</li> \t<li id=\"\">People that are tweeting regularly about a #hashtag that you follow</li> \t<li id=\"\">Twitter followers that are part of your local area (city, state or community)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your favorite authors or celebrities</li> \t<li id=\"\">Travel tweets that help you plan your next vacation</li> \t<li id=\"\">Local businesses (e.g. coffee shop, restaurant, etc)</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;4. Share Quality Content...Daily</h2><p id=\"\">The biggest struggle for any business owner or entrepreneur is finding and sharing content consistently. The question I’m always asked is where to find tweetable content, what to talk about and how to best curate it.</p><p id=\"\">My answer is always the same. More than likely, you have an immense amount of content right at your fingertips and just don’t realize it.</p><p id=\"\">Here are a few ideas on where you might have content hiding and how to share it.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Share photos of your latest presentation, event or business conference.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Links to your latest blog post, including quotes or key takeaways.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Details about a local charity that you support.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Insider tips that help your customer better understand your product or service.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Customer testimonials that tell your story through the eyes of a third party.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Q&amp;A using questions frequently asked about your business or service.</li></ul><p id=\"\">Think through what content you have on your website, blog or within your traditional marketing materials such as flyers or newsletters. Repurposing your content is a smart way to get your evergreen content in front of a fresh set of eyes.</p><p id=\"\">Here’s one example of how I use this strategy. In this tweet, I took a quote from a recent #InfluencerChat and created a visual graphic.</p><p id=\"\">\"To drive business forward, you must stay social. A business plan keeps you relevant &amp; consistent.\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/InfluencerChat?src=hash\">‍</a></p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;5. Add Visuals to Your Tweets</h2><p id=\"\">That leads me right into my next point. It’s no secret how important <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-visual-content-your-audience-will-love/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">visual marketing</a> has become. However, finding time to fit it into your daily content curation process can be tough.</p><p id=\"\">That’s why I’m sharing this simple solution for incorporating visual marketing in your social media activities (without it taking up a lot of time and energy).With Post Planner, you can share content as a link post and have the featured image show up within your Twitter feed.</p><p id=\"\">No more spinning wheels trying to save, download or create new images to share. Now you can drop a link into the composer, have the image auto-populate -- then send the post immediately or choose to schedule it for later.</p><p id=\"\">So, what’s the difference between this and how other tools render that featured image? Just take a look.Here’s what it looks like in your Twitter newsfeed:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823426251933777403e77_Image-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Image 2\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Now compare that to a share from Sprout Social and Hootsuite where both look like this:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823426251937d48403e75_Image-3.png\" alt=\"Image 3\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">You have to click “view summary” to see the image.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282342625193751d403e7e_Image-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Image 4\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Think about the amount of hours you've just earned back within your week!</p><h2 id=\"\"> &nbsp;6.

Use Twitter Advanced Search to Thank Your Supporters</h2><p id=\"\">This is my second tip for anyone creating unique content.

Use Hashtags</h2><p id=\"\">Hashtags are a way to get your message in front of a much larger audience. Take time to <a href=\"http://www.taylorclark.co/5-tips-better-twitter-hashtag/\" id=\"\">identify what hashtags are being used</a> consistently.</p><p id=\"\">To begin your hashtag research, look to your competition.

Join Twitter Chats</h2><p id=\"\">Twitter chats are an excellent way to connect with like-minded individuals who are tweeting about the same content that excites you.</p><p id=\"\">As co-founder and co-host of two Twitter chats - <a href=\"http://twitter.com/influencerchat\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">#InfluencerChat</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/viralchat\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">#ViralChat</a>, I can tell you first hand the power of chats.</p><p id=\"\">Since starting them in April and May of 2015, I've gained an average 4300 targeted followers per month.

Mistake: Mimic the Competition</h2><p>Herman Melville once said, <em id=\"\">“It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.”</em>It’s no different with Facebook marketing. Savvy marketers know that if you want to die a quick death – try to be anything but yourself.While it might be true that there are no new ideas, there is your unique perspective. Insight, experience, and wisdom are woven into everything you do.And consider this, adding context to your content creates differentiation. On the flip side, mimicking your competition makes you look unoriginal. It lacks the distinctive flair needed to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/stand-online/\" id=\"\">stand out online</a>.Not to mention the severe impact swiping your competitors' ideas will have on your brand. Don't be that copycat.To avoid this, take the time to make everything you do undeniably you. From content to visuals, everything you post should scream your brand.Speaking at <a href=\"http://rebekahr.com/1gRbhzk\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Media Examiner's #SMSS15</a> last week, I shared this easy tip.When creating visuals, use a consistent color palette—it’s the glue that ties your brand together and the identifier that makes your content stand out.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823425c4c4cd935410749_create-a-consistent-message-and-brand-700x393.jpeg\" alt=\"create a consistent message and brand\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Remember:</em></strong> to maintain your originality, you need to ensure that your message, voice, and tone is consistent. Become a destination by creating posts worth reading and content worth spreading.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Mistake: Neglect Facebook Fans</h2><p>Smart marketers know that happy customers are likely to come back. Not only that, they might even recommend your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-facebook-to-market-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook page</a>, expanding your fan base organically.One of the most effective ways to keep your customers happy is through active listening and a quick response time.And it should go without saying that honesty is the best policy when responding.As you know, people are always paying attention. They want to know that what you say and what you do is one in the same.Just as <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/convert-social-media-leads-into-paying-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">great customer service</a> sets your company apart, so does transparency. It can also be the key to continued growth through word of mouth marketing. It’s no shock that happy customers tell others about their experience.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KLM/videos/10153248766910773/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">KLM Airlines</a> gets this. They not only give their fans something positive to talk about (and entertaining to look at), but they build trust and rapport by staying highly interactive.They’re building brand loyalty one comment at a time, allowing fans to become advocates, actively recommending the airline to other prospective customers.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823425c4c4c638841074d_klm-airlines.jpeg\" alt=\"klm airlines\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Mistake: Use a Facebook Profile as a Page</h2><p>Are you using Facebook to market your business through a personal profile, not a business page?

So, what does this look like?Review company goals and determine what you're trying to accomplish and how Facebook marketing will move you towards those goals.Once you know what you want to achieve, now begin to segment out your daily, weekly, and monthly posting strategy.A good strategy not only eliminates a last minute rush, but also allows you to act on purpose.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Here's an Example of a Facebook Daily Posting Strategy:</strong></h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823425c4c4c26ae410748_Facebook-daily-posting-plan.png\" alt=\"Facebook daily posting plan\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5.

Mistake: Share Anything and Everything</h2><p>Want to become a valuable resource to your Facebook community?Share relevant, thoughtful, interesting, and educational <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/become-a-content-marketing-powerhouse-secrets-to-a-super-sticky-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">content</a> – and share it often.In other words, become a giver. This is the best way to establish thought leadership and position you as an expert within that field.The challenge for many businesses is knowing how and what to post. On top of that, it’s understanding how to create a conversation worth getting involved in.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Here's a Few Tips to Get You Started</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Keep your posts focused. Stick to one topic per post. Be brief and informative.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your fans are moving at the speed of light. Make your posts simple to scan, read and understand.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Find the perfect mix of photos, links, and text-based posts. Rotate through each to see what’s working and what’s not.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Stay away from technical terms or industry jargon that your typical reader (someone not working within your business) wouldn’t understand.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don’t use acronyms or other terms that make your fans question what they mean. If a reader can’t quickly discern what you’re message is, they’ll move on with the possibility of never returning.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Read through your post. Does it feel clunky or uncomfortable? If it doesn’t flow for you, it won’t for your fans either.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Edit ruthlessly!</li></ul><p>And most of all, work to find your voice. That’s the tone of your page and the persona your fans will begin to interact with.A perfect example of this is boutique-style accessories company <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stelladot?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Stella &amp; Dot</a>. Their lighthearted marketing approach is a perfect match to their brand persona.Ready to work from home? Want to hang out with your pet all day?

Mistake: Not Making Valuable Connections</h2><p>As you begin to build momentum for your page, look to companies creating relevant content.Facebook marketing takes a lot of things to succeed, and one of those is <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-linkedin-to-become-a-networking-superstar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">networking</a>.Use Facebook search to find pages similar to yours.While many changes have taken place since Facebook Graph was originally launched (and sure, officially, it's dead), the benefits remain.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Use Facebook Search Strings to tap into pages your fans are already connected to and engaging with.</li><li> \tPages liked by people who like [your page] \t</li><li id=\"\">Pages like by people who live in [your city] and like [your page]</li> \t<li id=\"\">You can also use free tools like <a href=\"http://likealyzer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Likealyzer</a> to find your niche or industry pages.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823425c4c4ceb2f410747_likealyzer-700x310.png\" alt=\"likealyzer\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Now get interactive with those pages. Comment on their content, share it if it makes sense, and become an active part of their community.Not only do you build relationships that can extend your brand beyond your own efforts, but you raise awareness within a similar community.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final thoughts</h3><p>By now, you get that Facebook marketing isn't what it used to be.From algorithm updates to increased ad costs, marketing your business on Facebook has changed.But that doesn't mean it has to be hard.Once you learn the ins and outs, you can avoid (and prevent) fatal marketing mistakes.Which step will you take today?</p>",

You've even created valuable connections and started to see momentum.But results are few and far between. At least, results that truly matter.Now here's the good news.You can find success through four simple words.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Purpose</li> \t<li id=\"\">Innovation</li> \t<li id=\"\">Plan</li> \t<li id=\"\">Execution</li></ul><p>Not convinced?Let’s break them down to better understand why each one is a vital ingredient to your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/build-a-strong-social-media-presence/\" id=\"\">social media success</a>.</p><h1 id=\"\">4 Powerful Words That Will Scale UP Your Social Media Efforts</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Purpose</h2><p>Successful marketers know that purpose drives strategy.They also know that purpose is the reason why one company succeeds while another fails.It gives meaning to your efforts and creates passion in your work. (and an added bonus - it does the same for your team!)But <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-differentiation-through-social-media/\" id=\"\">finding your purpose in social media</a> isn’t always easy.Knowing why it supports your business goals and desired outcome can feel illusive.However, getting clear on your purpose is critical, because one thing is for certain.As the bullet train of social media continues to run full steam ahead - you either need to get onboard and learn how to it in a purposeful way - or risk getting run over by your competition.So, where do you begin?Look to those succeeding at social media. Understand what is working and why. How are they living and breathing their social media purpose?Take one of my favorite Facebook Pages as an example:<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DowntownCharlottesville/photos/pb.351794921507744.-2207520000.1444525461./1056968444323718/?type=3&theater\" id=\"\"> Charlottesville DowntownMall</a>.Now before you ask, I'll answer. Do I live in Charlottesville? No. Have I ever been there? No.Would I love to visit this city because of their page alone? ABSOLUTELY!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282341597397831d9281fb_Charlottesville-social-media-700x462.jpeg\" alt=\"Charlottesville social media\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The Charlottesville team does an amazing job speaking to their audience, and encouraging conversation.They GET their purpose and the message they're sharing. In fact, you see their purpose (to share the beauty of the area) in every single post.And their audience eats it up like a hot, just out of the oven donut on a cold winters day. Their content (and engagement) is THAT delicious.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Find Your Purpose</strong></h3><p>How can you become the Charlottesville of your industry, niche or local market?Begin by answering these seven questions.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">When you first hopped on social media, what was your number one reason? (e.g. to reach a targeted audience, cheap advertising, better connections - be honest)</li> \t<li id=\"\">What’s your number one reason today?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What 3 problems do you solve for your potential clients?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Can you articulate your solution to those problems across social media?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What do you see in your competitor's use of social media that you feel needs to change?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Will social media help you build trust and rapport with a market eager to buy your product/do business with your company?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is the purpose behind your use of social media strongly attached to your business objectives?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">2. Innovate</h2><p>I'm a firm believer that the only <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/6-habits-of-highly-successful-social-media-marketers/\" id=\"\">fast lane to success</a> is through innovation and education.The more you know and understand about social media, the easier it is to gain momentum.And once you gain momentum, you can claim an unfair advantage over your competition.But what does it actually mean to innovate? The best definition I’ve heard comes from <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2013/the-best-definition-of-innovation/\" id=\"\">Scott Berkun</a> who studied the word for years,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“Innovation is significant positive change.”</blockquote><p>Just look to innovators within any industry and you’ll see this in action. Not only are they the change everyone else revolves around, but they've also incorporated four core qualities.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Innovators are:</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Informed</li> \t<li id=\"\">Agile</li> \t<li id=\"\">Efficient</li> \t<li id=\"\">Responsive</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823415973971a4b9281fa_core-attributes-of-successful-social-media-marketers-700x632.jpeg\" alt=\"core attributes of successful social media marketers\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Get Ahead Through Innovation</strong></h3><p>Innovators know that the online world is constantly evolving. Just when you think you’ve mastered social media, another change pops up.You post an update, share an image and boom - those best practices are instantly outdated.To stay ahead, you must be willing to push outside preconceived limitations, and instead focus on a results oriented, data-driven outcome.What does that look like?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">It means that you:</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Use social media and all available technology to multiply efforts.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create opportunity through social media without waiting for it to drop in your lap.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Compete with nobody but yourself. While everyone is going one way, you go the other.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Commit to being the master of differentiation and standing out on social media.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Break down your social media growth goals into bite-sized, actionable and measurable pieces.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Voraciously learn. Devour everything and anything that will improve your productivity and efficiency, and cut dependencies.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">3. Plan</h2><p>David Allen, the productivity guru, said In “Getting Things Done” that,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“'Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action.”</blockquote><p>Failure in <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/strengthen-your-social-media-strategy-right-now/\" id=\"\">social media</a> is most often brought about by a lack of planning and preparation.<strong id=\"\">But imagine…</strong></p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Being able to quickly identify where to best spend your time online.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Not wasting hours of your day spent on social media.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Gaining new business connections, expanding your reach and growing your business in ways you never thought possible.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Earning incredible opportunities as your business presence elevates and expands.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Establishing your business as the go-to professional within your field.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Working a daily social media strategy that is both easy and effective.</li></ul><p>Believe it or not, it's all very possible. With the right <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/effective-social-media-business-plan/\" id=\"\">social media business plan</a> in place, it can be manageable, measurable and -- offer explosive results.Plus, with a plan in place, you can say goodbye to the hunt and peck method of social media marketing. Here's how...</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">First Step: Look Ahead</strong></h3><p>Clearly spell out where you want to be. For example:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Global industry leader due to a clear, measurable and achievable social media strategy.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Dominant player in the market through word of mouth marketing, strategic alliances, and a company aligned inbound marketing plan.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Offer obsessive customer service that translates into significant customer retention and satisfaction.</li></ul><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Next Step: Write Out Your Plan</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Track Your Starting Point:</strong> Identify where you are today and capture that in an Excel sheet, Word or Google doc.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Know Your Audience:</strong> Who is your target market? Understand their area of expertise, what they’re talking about online and how you’ll use content to make a connection.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Choose Your Social Networks:</strong> Know where your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" id=\"\">target market</a> is spending time online and then master that network.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Create a Consistent Schedule:</strong> The only way to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/solid-social-media-strategy/\" id=\"\">build a solid social media following</a> is to stay in the conversation.

Execution</h2><p>Now that you’re clear on why you’re using social media and how you’ll use it going forward,  now it’s time to get strategic about your execution.Larry Wolff, CEO of Wolff Strategy Partners, a provider of interim executive and technology services, says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“95% of companies I consult with have strategic goals not met.  This is due to a lack of goal setting and execution. A plan is either not communicated effectively to other team members or worse yet - no plan is in place - leaving the execution up in the air.”</blockquote><p>If you want to turn social media into the catalyst that drives you toward your goals, realize that execution is your key.Does it have to be perfectly executed every single time? Absolutely not.Practice makes perfect, and a commitment to your social media strategy is essential.Consistency builds trust. It also allows you to create a workable, sustainable and successful plan.Execute, execute, execute!</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>Your social media success is directly impacted by your willingness to dive in and get a little dirty.What do I mean by that?Don't be afraid to make mistakes.And as a recovering perfectionist, I have much to learn in that area.But as Sam Rizvi, CIO of Post Planner, always reminds me,<em id=\"\">Done is better than perfect.</em>Don't let your fear of putting something out there at 75% complete keep you 100% out of the game.Keep pushing, keep moving, keep doing and most importantly - keep learning.</p><p id=\"\">Always remember: Done is better than perfect.

      "wp-yoast-seo-title": "4 Ways to Increase Facebook Page Engagement (and WOW Your Fans)",
      "wp-content": "<p id=\"\">Drive growth, build momentum and increase Facebook fan page engagement with a few simple strategies.</p><p id=\"\">Keeping your fans alert, involved and eager to contribute is imperative to your page showing up in their newsfeed.</p><p id=\"\">These tips will help you stay in front of your fans and take them from fan to paying clients!</p><h2 id=\"\">Use Images</h2><p id=\"\">Images are a powerful way to quickly earn reaction from your fans. They have the ability to excite, inspire, and delight. Images can generate an instantaneous and strong emotional response.</p><p id=\"\">With the rollout of Timeline, images are more influential then ever. In a recent survey by <a href=\"http://lp.wildfireapp.com/rs/wildfire/images/OptimizingContentfortheNewTimelineFormat_ATrackingStudyof43Brands.pdf\" id=\"\">Wildfire</a>, it was found that posts with graphics garner a much greater response than those without. In fact, Wildfire stated that “Photos are the best at generating comments, outperforming the next best post type by 8.3%.”</p><p id=\"\">This does not mean you need to include a graphic with every one of your posts, but it does offer important insight into capturing the attention of your fans.</p><p id=\"\">Your images can stand alone with nothing more then one or two words needed. The Ellen DeGeneres Show employs this tactic with exceptional results on a consistent basis:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822110480caa471c3dd5a_Increase-Facebook-Fan-Page-Engagement.jpeg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Fan Page Engagement\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Another strategy is one that I use quite often when posting a blog or web article. Include your eye-popping image along with the link or URL at the end of your Facebook post. Your image will immediately draw them in and hopefully entice them to click through to your article.</p><h2 id=\"\">Use a Clear Call to Action</h2><p id=\"\">A strong call to action includes a simple request leaving no doubt in your fans mind what you would like them to do. &nbsp;Never leave fan reaction to chance. Give them a compelling reason to take action via consistent, relevant and beneficial content.</p><p id=\"\">A few ways you can encourage a specific reaction is through open-ended questions. For example:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Fill in the blank: Have you ever _____?</li><li id=\"\">We __________. What do you think?</li><li id=\"\">What is your favorite __________?</li><li id=\"\">What if you could _________?</li><li id=\"\">Finish this sentence: &nbsp;________</li><li id=\"\">We love _________. What’s your favorite?</li></ul><p id=\"\">Another simple way to direct your fans is by spelling out the specific action you would like them to take. Do not assume that your fans know what you would like them to do. Tell them!</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">LIKE this post if…</li><li id=\"\">Click LIKE if you agree, if you love, if you could…</li><li id=\"\">SHARE if you love this as much as we do or if you’ve found this valuable</li><li id=\"\">Tag yourself in this photo if you agree…</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Use a Status Update</h2><p id=\"\">There is no denying that a simple status update still packs a punch whether you are a big brand or mom and pop shop. The status update is an easy way to relate to your fans in a fun and entertaining way without the complication of images, links or video.</p><p id=\"\">One big brand that uses this strategy almost exclusively is Skittles. Their fans have come to know and appreciate the short, witty and entertaining way the brand endears themselves to their fans on a daily basis.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822110480ca35b7c3dd59_skittles-300x144.png\" alt=\"skittles\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Use Video</h2><p id=\"\">While images are powerful, video can be just as effective. However, people are moving quickly when they are on Facebook so keep your videos short, informative and entertaining.</p><p id=\"\">You want your fans to walk away feeling uplifted, encouraged or as if they have gained wisdom and knowledge from your video.</p><h4 id=\"\">Set yourself apart by offering an enormous amount of value and watch your message spread like wildfire!

At the bottom of your post you will see how many people that specific post reached along with how many new likes to the post or page you received.</p><p id=\"\">If you want to test out promoted posts, there are a several key things to remember.</p><ol id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Promoted posts are only available to pages with a minimum of 400 likes.</li><li id=\"\">You are only able to run promotions on posts published after June 21, 2012.</li><li id=\"\">You cannot choose the date and time your post runs. Once your promoted post is approved, it will run until your goal has been met.</li><li id=\"\">Any type of content can be promoted including images, links, videos and status updates. A good rule of thumb is to promote a post that's visually appealing, offers exclusive or time restrictive content or promotes an upcoming event.</li><li id=\"\">Once you’ve promoted a post you can always pause it, cancel it or adjust your budget. You will only be charged based on the results received at that point.</li></ol><h2 id=\"\">How to Use Facebook Promoted Posts</h2><p id=\"\">1. &nbsp;Choose the post you wish to promote and click on the promote button on the lower right side of the post to get started.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282340271573824799751d_Facebook-Promoted-Posts-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Facebook Promoted Posts 4\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">2. &nbsp;You now have two options: do you want to promote the ad to your fans only or to friends of fans as well?

Once it’s approved you will receive a confirmation email. You're now off to the races!</p><h2 id=\"\">Monitor Your Progress</h2><p id=\"\">Savvy marketers monitor their progress and then adjust their strategy based on statistical data. A few best practices when using Facebook promoted posts:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Assign an ad name to each of your promoted posts making it much easier to track their effectiveness. By default, Facebook targets the United States plus many other countries. &nbsp; If reaching fans in say the Ukraine isn’t your target, go ahead and make the necessary adjustments so you don’t waste time or budget on an irrelevant audience.</li><li id=\"\">Perform a split test to check the effectiveness of this new tool rather then just pushing ahead blindly. &nbsp;A simple way to conduct a split test is to send out a Sponsored Page Post Ad and a Promoted Post to page fans only. Monitor your progress and determine which method garners the best results.</li><li id=\"\">Determine what type of post you want to promote. It might be a sweepstakes or a new product rollout. Whatever the case, choose wisely. &nbsp;Your goal is increased engagement so make the post fun, appealing and easy to respond to. You will receive a lot more feedback when you choose a topic your fans are passionate about and one that doesn’t require much thought to take action.</li><li id=\"\">Be careful not to get too “click happy” with promoted posts. &nbsp;There is an option to always promote my most recent post. Facebook marketers who choose this option can blow a media budget quickly. You might be better off to specifically select the posts you want to push into the news feed.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">The Pros and Cons of Promoted Posts</h2><p id=\"\">If you typically receive 30-40% reach on your posts, promoted posts may not be for you. &nbsp; Those statistics prove that you are already doing an excellent job engaging your community. Spending additional advertising dollars is not necessary as your base is already actively seeking out your page.</p><p id=\"\">If your reach is under 10% then promoted posts are worth considering and may help you re-engage and reconnect with fans that haven’t seen your posts in a while. &nbsp; One excellent advantage of the promoted post? &nbsp; Unlike regular Facebook ads and sponsored stories seen on the right sidebar, promoted posts can reach mobile users. That feature alone makes them an intriguing option for many marketers.</p><p id=\"\">Will you consider Facebook promoted posts?

YouTube Live</h2><p>When YouTube launched in 2005, no one could have predicted its meteoric rise or the amount of video we'd soon consume.By 2010, YouTube was serving over <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/youtube-serving-up-two-billion-videos-daily-20100517-v8sf.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">2 million views</a> per day.Today, YouTube has over 1.9 billion logged in users per month <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/02/you-know-whats-cool-billion-hours.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">watching 1 billion hours of video</a>.</p><h5 id=\"\">Create your first live video</h5><p>5 tips from Video Influencers:</p><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Plan your stream</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pick the right equipment</li> \t<li id=\"\">Setup your live stream</li> \t<li id=\"\">Consider having a second screen</li> \t<li id=\"\">Optimize video for replay</li></ol><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-2tDF3wiXo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Facebook Live</h2><p>Not familiar with <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/how-to-do-your-first-facebook-live/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook Live Video</a>? Wondering what the benefits are to you and your business?The biggest advantage is that the Live Video option is built right into Facebook. No more searching for the right app.Simply open the Facebook home page, click on the “status” button at the top, and choose the live video icon. Just like that you can start broadcasting your message and have it appear in the news feed.</p><h5 id=\"\">Here’s a few extra benefits:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">As the video is shooting, you see how many people are watching the video, as well as their names and comments.</li> \t<li id=\"\">As soon as it’s over, the video is automatically saved to your timeline.</li> \t<li id=\"\">From there you can share it, tweet it, embed it in blog posts, or delete it.</li></ul><p>And here's where it gets even better. Unlike some apps, these videos don't disappear!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAiAddysonZhang%2Fvideos%2F226474618262881%2F&show_text=0&width=560\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Instagram Live</h2><p>Instagram Live is another excellent live streaming option to build influence. While <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/how-to-do-your-first-facebook-live/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook</a> and YouTube offer the most customizable and branded options, Instagram is a great way to engage and interact in a relaxed and more natural environment.No matter where you are or what you're doing, going live on Instagram can take your audience:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Behind the scenes of your business</li> \t<li id=\"\">On a step-by-step mini-training or series that plays out over a duration of time</li> \t<li id=\"\">Into your exact process, system or product</li> \t<li id=\"\">With you on your unique journey</li></ul><p>The sky is the limit!</p><h5 id=\"\">To get started, open Instagram and <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/292478487812558\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">follow these steps</a>:</h5><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Tap in the top left of the screen or swipe right from anywhere in Feed.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Tap Live at the bottom of the screen, then tap Go Live.</li> \t<li id=\"\">The number of viewers appears at the top of the screen and comments appear at the bottom.

From there, you can tap Save in the top right to save it to your camera roll, or share it to your story.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Snapchat</h2><p>While not really Live Streaming, you can create <a href=\"https://support.snapchat.com/ca/live-stories\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Live Stories</a> with Snapchat.The idea behind it is “deleted content.” Your “story” only lives online for 24 hours before it's gone forever.While the demographics don’t make this the perfect network for all businesses, for those diving in, there's a lot of room to own your space.If you're eager to capture the 25 and under crowd, Snapchat could be right for you.Just take a look at one of the brands using it with great success. <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/nine-brands-advertised-snapchat-super-bowl-163632\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Taco Bell</a> produced massive hype during the 2016 Super Bowl, teasing a mystery item across the United States.They eventually revealed the new “Quesalupa\" to their hungry Snapchat fans.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282340a53a59056fb375f9_taco-bell-live-streaming-snapchat-619x1100.jpeg\" alt=\"taco bell live streaming snapchat\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Periscope</h2><p>It's hard to ignore the success of Periscope and the <a href=\"https://qz.com/632017/its-official-meerkat-has-lost-the-live-streaming-battle-to-periscope/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">hard fall of competitor, Meerkat</a>. While Periscope is new compared to UStream and other pioneers, Periscope has created distinct differences within functionality.Periscope, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">owned by Twitter</a>, is interactive, allowing you to have a real conversation with your viewers. The audience can ask questions and post comments which appear on your screen where you can easily respond.With integration with Twitter, it also gives you reach into a large communityWhen you <strong id=\"\">broadcast live from Periscope</strong>, the link no longer simply tweets. Your scope will now autoplay (minus sound) in the Twitter feed.Mitch Jackson, an award-winning attorney here in Southern California, is a great example of how to add value to your Twitter feed through consistent use of Periscope video.</p><p id=\"\">Watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchjackson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">@mitchjackson</a>'s broadcast: 19 chapters of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/socialmedia?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">#socialmedia</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/communication?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">#communication</a> tips in my new book http://www.SocialMe… <a href=\"https://t.co/YJXIb7xMBl\" id=\"\">https://t.co/YJXIb7xMBl</a></p><blockquote id=\"\">— 🌀LivingINtheLeap©🦋 (@Enlighten__Up) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Enlighten__Up/status/1087071008832479232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" id=\"\">January 20, 2019</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  6. Google Hangouts</h2><p>Google Hangouts have been around longer than any I've listed above. Yet, I still find usage among business owners is spotty and somewhat misunderstood.In reality, Hangouts are very easy to use, especially since they became a standalone app.As a team, we use them daily. Between <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" id=\"\">Slack</a> and <a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/\" id=\"\">Hangouts</a>, the ability to communicate via text, face to face and screen sharing is invaluable.I've also been using them since their beta days to conduct interviews like this one with Peg Fitzpatrick and Guy Kawasaki during the launch of their book, \"<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2S7yLaU\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">The Art of Social Media: Power Tips for Power Users</a>.\"</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7N8Ns2qEiq8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"> The Best Ways to Use Live Streaming Video in Your Business</h2><h2 id=\"\">  1. Create an Interview Series</h2><p>With the emergence of <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/how-to-manage-social-media-without-losing-your-mind/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a>, business success depends on product and service almost as much as the likability of the brand.How conversational, interactive, and open you are with your audience goes a long way towards building an engaged community.And an engaged community according to <a href=\"http://www.rosetta.com/reports/customer-engagement-rosetta-consulting-study/customer-engagement-from-the-consumers-perspective/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Rosetta</a> is worth its weight in gold.</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"Engaged consumers buy 90% more frequently, spend 60% more per transaction and are five times more likely to indicate it is the only brand they would purchase in the future. All of these factors lead to <strong id=\"\">engaged customers delivering three times the value to the brand</strong> over the course of a year.\"</blockquote><p>Creating an interview series can share a more personal side of your brand. It can also give special insight into who you are, your area of expertise, and the products/services your business offers.Facebook and YouTube are perfect platforms for this.Whether you're promoting a product or running an interview style roundtable like I did here with <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/sem2/?ref=8847019530&refer_source=&utm_source=berush&utm_medium=promo&utm_campaign=link\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">SEMrush</a>, make sure your videos are:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Relatable</li> \t<li id=\"\">Appealing</li> \t<li id=\"\">Value Based</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41IMP32uIGs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Give a Sneak Peek</h2><p>Everybody loves going behind the scenes, getting insider information or a sneak peek into what's up and coming.Live streaming apps can give you the real time ability to share company news or jump on a trending story.And if you're ready to take it to a whole new level, <strong id=\"\">integrate two live streams</strong> at the same time. For example, share your Periscope on Twitter or take snippets of your Facebook Live and share as Instagram Stories.</p><h5 id=\"\">How to use this in your business:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Give your viewers a quick tour of your facilities</li> \t<li id=\"\">A quick video of your day-to-day process or system</li> \t<li id=\"\">A walkthrough of how your product is created</li></ul><p>The goal is to build engagement and an appreciation of your business as you take it from “abstract” to “real” in mere minutes.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Live Stream Events in Real Time</h2><p>Attending an event? Share it with your audience!Give your viewers a glimpse of  an event you're attending. But don't just stop there.Talk with your audience about the event - why you're there, what your participation is (are you speaking?), and how often they'll hear from you while there.Make your audience feel like they're hanging out with you, live at the event.Mia Voss puts this into practice daily. Wherever she is, we get to go along with her. And the beauty in it? You can do the same thing with Facebook Live from your business page, personal account or Group.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmia.voss%2Fvideos%2F10215802524752505%2F&show_text=0&width=267\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Set up a Video Conference</h2><p>Love what you do? Ready to share your expertise with the world?Don't wait for those speaking engagements to come to you, create your own video conference!When <a href=\"https://belive.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">BeLive</a> first hit the scene, many newcomers eager to <strong id=\"\">test the limits of the platform</strong> put this idea into action.And the great news is it doesn't have to be difficult or overwhelming to put together.</p><h5 id=\"\">Who to Invite to Your Conference</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Company leaders</li> \t<li id=\"\">Influencers or experts in your field</li> \t<li id=\"\">Product users or past clients</li> \t<li id=\"\">Employees / Brand Advocates</li> \t<li id=\"\">Leaders with a specialized niche</li> \t<li id=\"\">And the list goes on and on!</li></ul><p><em id=\"\">A word of caution:</em> this isn't a moment to \"wing it.\" If you're going to put a several hour, half day or full day event together - be prepared!Outline the agenda, be clear in the timing, share discussion topics and make sure to leave room for audience participation.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Repurpose Content for Video Training</h2><p>One of the best ways to leverage live streaming is to repurpose current content for training purposes.This is something I regularly with great success. I'm a firm believer in getting the most mileage out of one piece of content.As Mike Allton with <a href=\"https://bloggingbrute.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Blogging Brute</a> recently wrote,</p><blockquote id=\"\">What if I told you that a single one-hour video that you broadcast live to Facebook will generate dozens and dozens of pieces of content that you can use to fuel your content marketing efforts both on your blog and on every other major social network?</blockquote><p>YES! Use your video content or blog content as a way to extend the shelf life while giving it maximum exposure. There's two ways to get started:</p><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Use <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/how-to-create-25-pieces-of-content-from-a-single-facebook-live-broadcast/547372/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Mike's formula here</a> to turn your video into 25 pieces of content.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use your highest performing (top trafficked) content and translate that into new media.</li></ol><p>Take your blog post (the one that continues to bring traffic to your website) and pull out 2-3 points. Now expand upon each one, sharing an in-depth look at one specific topic.Your audience is eager to learn, take the time to teach them something new. Not only will this position you as an expert within your field, but it also pulls your audience in - allowing them to get actively involved.As opposed to the standard webinar where you're speaking at your viewers, live streaming lets them add their voice to the conversation.</p><h5 id=\"\">Getting Started</h5><p>Remember...</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">For Periscope, viewers can send comments and type their questions.

Be Topical and Relevant</h2><p>Have a breaking story within your industry?

Give Your Audience the Content They Crave</h2><p>While much has been written about increasing social media engagement, one basic fundamental will always stand.Providing valuable content to a group of eager and hungry consumers will increase conversation and amplify your message.Consistently analyze your analytics to assess what content resonates best. Do pictures, videos or links perform better?Adjust your strategy and your content when appropriate to keep your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" id=\"\">social media content</a> fresh and your information relevant.Just look to experts like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RazorSocial/posts/1020355624683574\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Ian Cleary with Razor Social</a> and see how they add personality to social content effortlessly.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282340f47c9570b93e183d_razor-social-ian-cleary.jpeg\" alt=\"razor social ian cleary\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"> 2. Offer Valuable Information</h2><p>The single most effective way to build loyalty and trust is by sharing valuable and useful information with no strings attached.Make use of your expertise by giving away a series of useful tips.Fluff is nice, but information that can be used to save money, make money, and win in negotiations will keep your audience tuned in and coming back for more.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 3. Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile</h2><p>Optimize your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-linkedin-to-become-a-networking-superstar/\" id=\"\">LinkedIn profile</a> with keywords specific to your expertise and location.For example, if you specialize in short sales in Lexington, KY, your keywords would be “Short Sale Specialist Lexington Kentucky.”These are searchable terms that allow people to quickly find you when searching real estate professionals in your area.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282340f47c9580263e183e_linkedin-profile-tips.jpeg\" alt=\"linkedin profile tips\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"> 4. Leverage the Power of Instagram</h2><p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so share your story across this visual medium.As one of the newer networks on the block, Instagram is rife with social media faux pas. If you want to expand your presence over there, you need to know a few do’s and dont’s.</p><h5 id=\"\">Instagram Etiquette Do’s and Dont’s</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Never ask people to follow you; leave them to their own initiative. Instead, work on the image you wish to project and let followers naturally connect with you.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Be considerate and limit your number of posts. Nobody wants your content to fill up their entire feed.</li> \t<li id=\"\">You get what you give. Engage with other people’s photos and give them a reason to engage with yours.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use hashtags where appropriate, but don’t use hashtags that aren’t relevant to your photo.</li></ul><p>As <a href=\"http://www.suebzimmerman.com/\" id=\"\">Sue B. Zimmerman</a>, aka The #InstaGal says,Instagram is a goldmine of a business-building tool that you don‘t want to overlook.However, don’t just grab content for the sake of posting something. Be strategic and tailor your content to the network and your audience.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/6Alf4_Jxkl/\" target=\"_top\" id=\"\">▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ ➤ This.Is.Biggggg Scheduling Instagram posts is now a reality with #Hootsuite! ➤ As social media managers this is one of the most common problems and questions we've had to address.

(@theinstagramexpert) on Aug 5, 2015 at 9:55am PDT</p><h2 id=\"\"> 5. Incorporate Eye-Catching Images and Video</h2><p>Consumers are visual.  If you want to quickly capture their attention, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-visual-content-your-audience-will-love/\" id=\"\">add images</a> that are eye-catching and pleasing to the eye.Include Infographics, quotes, behind-the-scenes images of your business, local attractions within your area, charts explaining market trends, industry news or video tips.Each option will allow your audience to obtain the message in a visual format, giving them a richer media experience.Look to <a href=\"http://instagram.com/nike\" id=\"\">Nike</a> as an example of one brand benefiting from the early adoption of visual marketing.Their clever use of visual content, especially on <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-instagram-to-expand-business-reach/\" id=\"\">Instagram</a>, has created a flurry of activity.Take a look at their profile and you’ll see how they’ve woven brand imaging, messaging and hashtags into a very <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/solid-social-media-strategy/\" id=\"\">effective strategy</a>.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/5XUzeMgUbL/\" target=\"_top\" id=\"\">You can quit. Or you can quit complaining. Find your fast at Nike.com/Zoom</a></p><p id=\"\">A photo posted by nike (@nike) on Jul 20, 2015 at 9:20am PDT</p><h2 id=\"\"> 6. Ask Thought-Provoking Questions</h2><p>Engaging social media fans and followers requires that you branch out from simply pushing out content.People want more and in order to connect with you, they will require that you give more.If you want to get your audience involved, you will need to ask questions, offer advice and give valuable insight.  Your goal is not to simply entertain, but to make your audience think and want to respond.Ask questions that inspire, ignite and fuel conversation.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 7. Monitor Your Reputation</h2><p>Monitoring your online reputation is an incredibly important part of your strategy.Stay on top of what is being said about you and your business and respond proactively.Social media should not be a bullhorn, used only to attract and convert leads. Instead, use your social media channels and other available online tools to listen in on conversations and maintain the established offline reputation you have worked so hard to build.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822326c28f421b6e40d4b_social-mentiion.png\" alt=\"social mention monitoring\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"> 8. Use Twitter to Drive Website and Blog Traffic</h2><p>Twitter can be used to increase traffic to your website or blog through thoughtful and strategic sharing.Two strategies to increase website visibility:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Tweet Your Latest Post: Notify your Twitter followers of your latest post by tweeting it as soon as you hit publish.</li></ul><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Hashtags: Identify relevant hashtags based on industry, niche and location. Use hashtags within your tweets to place your content in front of a larger audience. Use Twitter Advanced Search to find top searches performed by and hastags used by your target market.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428233ff54066783d5d8088_twitter-advanced-search-.png\" alt=\"twitter advanced search\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"> 9. Create an Integrated Social Media Campaign</h2><p>As a business professional, social media should complement your overall marketing strategy.This means weaving traditional marketing and online or social marketing into a long-term plan and allowing each to support one another.The best way to go about this is by adopting an integrated social media campaign for your business. Creating an omni-channel social media marketing campaign means linking your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Google+, and YouTube accounts to your overall marketing strategy.This combines email marketing with landing pages and sales objectives so that all roads lead to your goals.It also means that no matter where your potential client might be, they are able to find and connect with you.Accomplish this by adding social media links to your Facebook fan page; including all social links within your email signature and adding social buttons to your website and blog.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Use an Editorial Calendar</h2><p>Tired of staring blankly at the computer screen, agonizing over what to post to your social media channels? You need an editorial calendar!An editorial calendar is an incredibly useful social media tool that creates consistency by acting as your posting roadmap.Taking the time to create a calendar allows you to post on purpose, rather than using social media in a hit-or-miss way.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282207f47c95372d3e02d5_blog-content-calendar.jpeg\" alt=\"blog content calendar\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>Social media requires investment.

Brand Your Business</h2><p>If you want to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-facebook-to-market-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create a memorable brand</a> on Facebook, you must clearly articulate who you are, what you do, and how you help your fans and customers.Not only that, you must keep your branding consistent. Better branding equals heightened awareness, and that translates into better engagement.From you Facebook graphics to your logo, videos, and cover image - create a seamless look and feel that's a direct representation of your company.One of the first things people will see is your cover photo. It's a perfect place to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/build-a-sensational-personal-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">brand your business</a> and tell your story.But don't just stop there. Use it to promote your products, share what's happening within your business and talk about upcoming events.And make sure you change out that cover often!I recently changed mine to promote an upcoming Facebook webinar.

Use Friend Power to Build a Tribe</h2><p>Back in 2013, Nielsen released an advertising study in which they noticed participants showed much greater recall of ads if Facebook friends’ icons appeared under who “Liked” that particular product.Today, Nielsen reports that 92% of consumers trust a recommendation from family and friends over all forms of advertising.Granted, this study was about advertising; not about Facebook Pages – but their conclusion shouldn’t be ignored.All it takes is one enthusiastic “fan” to propel your Facebook Page towards super-status!Imagine how 45,000 and 11,000 shares could help your business get noticed.</p><blockquote id=\"\">20 of the most wow-worthy bathrooms we've ever seen: http://bit.ly/1Srv6sHPosted by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mybhg\" id=\"\">Better Homes and Gardens</a> on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mybhg/posts/10153612697776019:0\" id=\"\">Saturday, July 18, 2015</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  3. Build Out Your About</h2><p>Facebook is a visual medium. Make sure all of your important details are front and center.Include links to webinars, videos, upcoming events you're hosting, and in-depth information about you, your product and/or service.</p><h3 id=\"\">Tips to Help You Craft Your “About”</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Add your mission, vision and values along with any founding details that would matter to potential clients.</li> \t<li id=\"\">You have a short amount of time to gain the attention of potential fans.

Use the Call to Action Button</h2><p>A call to action isn’t just for your marketing material. You need to use it within your Facebook Page.Not familiar with the call to action button?

Keep Your Content Fresh</h2><p>Post daily and keep your content fresh and relevant. Change up your posts by using images, links, video and other media to monitor what works best in your community.And think through your content. For example, a humorous message that makes your community laugh will often engage an audience in a way that keeps readers coming back.And if people look forward to your posts, that's a hook that strengthens the ties to your page.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">PRO Tip:</strong></h4><p>The multiplication possibilities via Facebook are similar to the magic of compound interest.<strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Here’s how it works: </em></strong>When your friends and fans repost and comment on your page, the information spreads to their friends, and can be picked up repeatedly by another “generation” of friends.In that manner, the reach of your message can be unlimited. It's the Facebook version of “going viral,\" but the only way it's going to happen is if you post often and share valuable content.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Pay Attention to Your Insights</h2><p>Whether you're managing one Facebook Page or multiple Pages, Facebook Insights are an invaluable resource.Take a look at your audience statistics. Pay special attention to age, gender and country of residence. This is going to give you insight into who's connecting with your Page.Now, go one step further. Look at your total interactions and the interactions per post.Identify <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/159526011777637867/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">what time is best to post</a> and what type of content is receiving the most engagement.Can you see how helpful that would be to your overall strategy?

Boost Your Posts...Wisely</h2><p>I'm often asked whether marketers should boost Facebook posts.Many have heard (and you might be one of them) that boosted posts are a waste of money.My response? Not true!At least not when boosted posts are targeted and specific.Want to see what this looks like in action? My friend Scott Ayres, author of <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1SDc4kZ\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook All-In-One for Dummies</a> recently shared results from one boosted post campaign.By spending just $65 on Facebook, his boost post results were:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Reach -- 13166</li> \t<li id=\"\">Actions -- 466</li> \t<li id=\"\">Photo Clicks -- 163</li> \t<li id=\"\">Page Likes -- 44</li> \t<li id=\"\">Post Likes -- 212</li></ul><p>So how did he do it? I'll let him explain...<em id=\"\">via </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/scottwayres\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Scott Ayres</em></a>When you boost a post you need to be careful how you do it or you may end up wasting your money.Clicking the \"Boost Post\" button on a post will show you something similar to this:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823406a10ec580856e94f_boosted-post-breakdown.png\" alt=\"boosted post breakdown\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>NEVER choose the \"People who like your Page and their friends\" selection -- unless your Page/product is a global product.Choosing \"People who like your Page\" is great for reigniting engagement with people who may not have interacted with you in some time.I tend to use the \"People you choose through targeting\" selection most often.Facebook targeting allows me to choose a specific audience -- which means a mix of existing followers and new prospects.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642823406a10ec84ef56e94e_facebook-ad-audience.png\" alt=\"facebook ad audience\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>I get the most return on my ad spend and when I target the ad by demographics.Want to learn more?

Be a Part of the Conversation</h2><p>Visit your page frequently and actively connect with your fans. Engaging daily with your community is the quickest and most effective way to build trust and credibility.Invite feedback by asking open ended questions that can lead to long and lively discussions. Ask for responses — simply ending your message with a “what do you think?” or “do you agree?” can often get the party started.And be responsive!Always monitor your fan page so that you can respond to questions and comments quickly. It keeps the discussion and interest up, shows appreciation for those who are reaching out to you, and is the ideal opportunity to engage with new people.Facebook is about connecting socially and can be a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/kickstart-a-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">powerful networking tool</a> if you focus your efforts on building and maintaining an entertainingly informative fan page.</p><h2 id=\"\">  11. Use testimonials</h2><p>Testimonials sharing real-life experience with your company go a long way in building credibility.Get people excited about sharing their thoughts on your page. Then take those and turn them into shareable graphics.Here's an idea to get people interested in sharing testimonials on your page via <a href=\"http://blog.wishpond.com/post/55106335016/4-strategies-for-how-to-get-customer-testimonials-on\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Wishpond</a>.<em id=\"\">\"According to </em><a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/study-72-of-consumers-trust-online-reviews-as-much-as-personal-recommendations-114152\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Search Engine Land</em></a><em id=\"\">, “72% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.” Asking your clients for written reviews of your product and having them post it on to your Facebook Page gives you authentic confessions that can add a boost to your product sales.

      "wp-content": "<h2 id=\"\">STEP 1: Identify Main Keyword Based on Intent</h2><p>Google’s Suggest Tool is the best place to start with your research. Go to Google.com and you’ll see Google Suggest at work. As soon as you begin to type, Google will suggest relevant search queries that match your topic. Those suggestions are based on how often past users have searched for a term (their popularity).Try searching for something like \"what is instagram\" and you’ll see what I mean.What you’re looking for is:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">A term that solves a problem a potential reader/customer actually has</li> \t<li id=\"\">Uses a term or phrase that they’d actually use</li></ul><p>Let’s say you’re writing an article about planning Instagram content. Think about what our audience would actually type in search.“How to plan content for my Instagram posts”“How do I create content for Instagram?”“How do I schedule content for Instagram?”“Instagram plan”Type these in and begin to write down the relevant terms Google serves up. I’d start with a list of 10-20. This will vary depending on the scope and specificity of your topic. (how narrow)</p><h3 id=\"\">Example:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">instagram content ideas</li> \t<li id=\"\">instagram content calendar</li> \t<li id=\"\">schedule instagram posts business</li> \t<li id=\"\">Instagram content strategy</li> \t<li id=\"\">instagram post strategy</li> \t<li id=\"\">content ideas for instagram</li></ul><p>Now take those ideas and head over to Quora, Buzzsumo, Reddit, and Ubersuggest to generate even more keyword ideas. UberSuggest is especially awesome in suggesting phrases you might not have thought of otherwise.Finally, add all of your keyword ideas into SEMrush to determine whether or not they’re worth going after.</p><h2 id=\"\">STEP 2: Identify volume, keyword difficulty, and opportunity</h2><p>Here we’re going to use SEMrush and a couple other tools to see whether or not these keywords are worth exploring. We’ll look at what the volume, difficulty in ranking, and the opportunity is for a particular keyword.What we don’t want to do is write one more piece of content in an already saturated niche that we have zero potential to rank for. Especially if the keyword difficulty is high. (more on that below)First, use Google search operator, “intitle,” to get a sense of what has already been written about, who has written about it, and how many results are showing up. In this case, there’s 207 articles with that exact keyword included.Who’s ranking, what’s the value of the content, and why is it ranking in your opinion?You’re looking for authority sites (Later, Hubspot, Buffer) as opposed to obscure sites that are unknown within the space. This can be a telling sign that the keyword isn’t one you want to go after.Now go to SEMrush and type in the keywords from the list that you brainstormed above. This is your starting point and a way to see volume, difficulty, and potential. This will more than likely be broad when first starting. (e.g. instagram hashtags) as opposed to instagram hashtag limit. (specific intent)Write down how many people are searching for that phrase (this is your volume). For example, instagram hashtags volume is 18,100 while instagram hashtags is 880. This is a starting point, but not always the best indicator as high volume doesn’t always equal high clicks.Optimally, you’re going to balance search volume with search intent as discussed above. You’re tying what they want to achieve (know, do, go) with what they want to accomplish (know the instagram hashtag limit).You’re also looking at keyword difficulty. SEMrush automatically generates a rank based on a combination of authority of the domains showing up and how hard it would be to outrank.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Above 80%: High Difficulty</li> \t<li id=\"\">From 60%-80%: Medium Difficulty</li> \t<li id=\"\">Below 40%: Low Difficulty</li></ul><p>Keywords below 40% are the easiest to rank for but the hardest to find. Keywords with difficulty below 40% that have steady search volume can also represent our best opportunities.You can also use SEMrush to see what specific articles from our competitors are ranking. More ideas! Go to SEMrush - SEO Toolkit and add competitor domain. I used Later as an example. You’ll begin with a high level overview of all keywords. I suggest you drill down into that through filters. Under “Organic Keywords,” click on view all.Now you’re going to use advanced filters to uncover those low(er) volume, 40% or below difficulty level keywords. Include - Keyword - Word matching = your main keyword.</p><h4 id=\"\">Final Step:</h4><p>Look at the average monthly searches (volume) and the keyword difficulty.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Search volume = demand</li> \t<li id=\"\">Relevance of keyword topic/phrase</li> \t<li id=\"\">True intent of our audience</li></ul><p>*IMPORTANT* As a part of this step, keep what we discussed above in mind.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Do we currently rank on Page 1? If so, it might be wise to attack another keyword. One we don’t currently rank for.</li></ul><p>Your last step is researching the titles and topics that are already ranking. What words do they use that inspire that traffic or those clicks?How can we answer the intent in the most interesting, innovative or provocative way?The goal is to write a piece that positions us as the expert while solving one of our audiences (and potential members) biggest problems.

Today, all anyone needs to do is Google you...or tweet a question to see how you respond.Twitter gives you the online advantage by putting you in the exact space your potential clients are spending their time. Don't miss the chance to take them from a possible lead to business advocate.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Drive Website and Blog Traffic</h2><p>Twitter can be used to increase traffic to your website or blog through thoughtful and strategic sharing.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3 Ways to Increase Website Visibility:</strong></h3><p><strong id=\"\">  1. Tweet Your Latest Post: </strong>Notify your Twitter followers of your latest post by tweeting it as soon as you hit publish.However, don't make the mistake of stopping there.  Tweak the verbiage within your tweet and send it out several additional times throughout the week.Monitor the effectiveness of each tweet. What worked? What gained the most traction? Now do it again!And make your life easier while scheduling those tweets. Use a third-party management tool such as <a href=\"http://hootsuite.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hootsuite</a> to schedule ahead. This will free up your time to actively engage rather than feeling tied to your computer.<strong id=\"\">  2. Hashtags:</strong> Identify relevant hashtags based on industry, niche and location.Use hashtags within your tweets to place your content in front of a larger audience. But be careful.One or two hashtags is all you need to get your point across. Too many hashtags just makes you look like a spammer and no one wants that reputation.Try a tool like <a href=\"http://hashtags.org\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">hashtags.org</a> to research the frequency and popularity of each keyword and its use.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428233ff54066931c5d8089_find-relevant-hashtags.png\" alt=\"find relevant hashtags\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong id=\"\">  3. Call to Action:</strong> A call to action isn’t just for your blog post.You need to use it within your tweet as well. For example, your latest blog post is titled “10 Ways to Stay Sane During Your Next Move.”Include within your tweet a question such as “Making a move?” or “Have you felt the pain of moving in the past?” Now tell your followers how you will solve their problem. It could read something like this,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“Making a move? It doesn't have to be difficult. How you can avoid moving day stress and stay sane!”</blockquote><p>Additional call to action ideas would be “find out more,” “click here for more details,” “don’t miss this tip,” and “watch this video for more details.”Think about that next step you want them to take and add that to the end.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Optimized Profile</h2><p>Your Twitter profile is the first stop for potential followers. They're going to land there, doing their research prior to clicking that follow button.When was the last time you updated your Twitter profile? Now might be the time to do a little housekeeping.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The top areas to optimize:</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li> \tYour bio - this should include information about your business, location, niche and passions. \t</li><li id=\"\">Your cover - include a custom header image that represents the look and feel of your personal brand both offline and online.</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Your profile picture - use a consistent profile image that easily connects people to you and <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/build-a-sensational-personal-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">your personal brand</a>.</li></ul><p>People are eager to connect with you, but in order to click that “follow” button, you need to give them a compelling reason.Take time to create a convincing bio and cover image that offers insight into your business.And make use of that real estate space like my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaraFHawkins\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Sara F.

      "wp-content": "<p>Do you know the purpose behind your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/profitable-blog-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blog</a>? Have you found a rhythm and flow to your writing?Do you know who you're speaking with and what niche you serve?If the answer is no to all of the above, don't panic. There's good news.Once you do know how to answer those questions - and you will - it makes all the difference.How do I know? I was a first-time blogger once too.Ten years ago when I started my first blog, I had no idea who my target audience was, let alone what their needs were.I stumbled around, writing, posting and hoping I'd tap into my passion.Guess what? I finally did...and you can too.Below I share a simple 6-part <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/better-blogger/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blogging formula</a> that helped me build my blog and is going to help you dominate any niche.</p><h1 id=\"\">How To Find Your Perfect Blog Niche (and Make a Profit)</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Know the Purpose Behind Your Blog</h2><p>Finding meaning in my writing was something I didn’t connect with immediately. I blogged about things I knew, but my heart just wasn't in it.My articles felt lifeless and my readership numbers reflected that.I needed a strategy and I needed it fast.  The problem was, there was no way I could define a strategy without purpose.I was sporadic and unfocused in my blogging and my words lacked conviction.  I needed a “blog intervention” and fast!While my intervention was slow to come, the questions I asked myself will hopefully help you move faster towards yours.Ask yourself these questions to identify the purpose behind your blog and writing.</p><h3 id=\"\">Questions to Find Your Blog's Purpose</h3><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Are you looking to find deeper meaning in your work and pass along the wisdom you've gained over your lifetime?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do you want to motivate and inspire people?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Will this be a full time commitment in support of a current or new business or is this a hobby?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are you looking to build a legacy or make a quick buck?</li></ol><h2 id=\"\">  2. Get Passionate About Your Topic</h2><p>If you said you want to blog full time and tie it to your income, then you must eat, sleep and breathe the subject matter.Consistently <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/build-a-successful-business-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blogging about your topic</a> creates authority, and authority is what creates opportunity.And if you want to make money around this topic and within your niche, the doors of opportunity need to swing wide open.That's what makes writing what you're passionate about extremely important.  Without passion, your content will feel forced. And forced or inauthentic content is something readers sniff out immediately.</p><h3 id=\"\">How to Find the Topic You're Passionate About</h3><p><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/writing-best-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Writing about your blog topic</a> should feel as natural as breathing to you.  If you want to find what moves and inspires you, follow this process.Open up your favorite note taking application (mine is an old fashioned pad and pen) and answer these questions.</p><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Write down the top 5 topics you would you write about if time and money weren't a factor? My examples:</li><li> \tDogs \t</li><li id=\"\">Wine</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Travel</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Motivation</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Health</li> \t<li id=\"\">What about those topics drives and excites you?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Can you put a new spin on that topic and make it unique?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Can you clearly articulate a benefit around the topic?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is there an audience for your topic?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is it a sustainable topic?</li></ol><p>Once you're finished, read back through your answers.What emerged for you? What topic stands out and feels right in your heart and gut?Now that you've got that, it's time to do your research and clearly answer number 5 and 6. Don't move forward without those details unless you're not in it to make a living.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Know Your Niche Inside and Out</h2><p>Now that you know the purpose behind your blog and <a href=\"http://www.twelveskip.com/guide/blogging/1408/strategies-to-find-your-blogging-niche\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">the niche you're going to serve</a>, it's time to learn that niche inside and out.Because here's one of my biggest tips. Successful bloggers know that understanding who you're speaking with is the first key to success.Look around at the most successful bloggers you know. You will quickly see that they're laser focused on the needs of their audience.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/michaelhyatt/photos/a.10150425974849385.362668.133149524384/10153187718284385/?type=1&theater\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Michael Hyatt</a> is an excellent example of  someone that's defined his niche. I've watched the evolution of his brand and it's clear that niching down has rapidly grown his credibility, visibility and engagement.Why? He's speaking his audience's language. He's not broad in his conversations, but zeroed in on how to solve their particular problem.From the moment you land on his blog, he has what any busy entrepreneur needs because he knows that niche inside and out.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428233e6a10ecb18856e93b_michael-hyatt-blog-purpose.jpeg\" alt=\"michael hyatt blog purpose\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>And it's that ability - the ability to get inside your audience's head - that creates a rhythm and flow to your writing.It gives your readers access into your thoughts, letting them hear you as if you were speaking them aloud.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Make Your Content Relevant and Useful</h2><p>To engage your readers on a consistent basis you must be totally in sync with their needs.Listen to their challenges, concerns and fears about what's happening in your niche.Figure out what keeps them awake at night and then craft your content around it.Your articles should be a refuge, an answer and a calming force.Give them what they are searching for and they will be forever grateful.So how can you do this? As Diana Adams of <a href=\"http://www.influencerchat.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">InfluencerChat.com</a> says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"Put yourself in your customer's shoes. What blogging topics would be valuable and useful to them? Get into the mind of your ideal customer. Make sure you choose a niche that you can write about over and over without getting tired of it.\"</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">   5. Be Willing to Create Conversation (and Start a Movement)</h2><p>Once you know your niche and start writing about it, you'll need to get into the conversation.Because writing great content is only the beginning. Your next step is promotion.Work daily to engage your readers, draw on their emotions, and ask them to discuss, debate and interact with you across your social channels.Your blog is the springboard to further conversation. Take your thoughts and ideas and work to create a movement around it.Ask open ended questions or offer free advice to draw your audience in.  Define your calls to action and how to let your audience take that next step with you or your company.Make your blog feel like home to them…a place where they belong and enjoy spending time.And of course, promote, promote, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/ways-to-promote-your-latest-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">promote your blog content</a>!</p><h3 id=\"\">Your Action Steps to Blog Promotion (and creating a movement and buzz around your content)</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Social Media</li><li> \tPost to your Facebook profile and page \t</li><li id=\"\">Post a graphic specifically designed for Google+ and then pin that graphic to Pinterest (the size that works best for me is 735 x 1200)</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Create a unique graphic for Instagram and share with a short breakdown of key points</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">LinkedIn – share to your profile and within a group. Writing about social media, marketing or small business? Become a member of the LinkedIn group I manage with over 35,000 members.</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Create a short “how-to” video highlighting some of the tips shared within your post. Add that to YouTube.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Blogger Communities</li> \t<li id=\"\">Video</li> \t<li id=\"\">Guest Posts</li> \t<li id=\"\">Commenting – Comment on blogs that fall within your niche. It’s an excellent way to create strategic relationships and connect with influencers within your niche.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Newsletter</li> \t<li id=\"\">Email Marketing</li> \t<li id=\"\">Syndication</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  6. Tell a Great Story</h2><p>I have one last piece of advice for you and while it should have made it further up on the list - I left it for last to make a lasting impact.Yep, it's that important so listen up.If you've struggled to share your story - or worse - your expertise, get over it.Your story is your gift. It's should be shared with others as a way to help, motivate and inspire.One of my favorite storytellers is Henneke with <a href=\"http://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-improve-writing-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Enchanting Marketing</a>. No one can weave a story quite like her.I feel myself drawn into every word as she makes the topic come to life. It's immediately relatable and easy to insert myself into the narrative.Here's what I mean...</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428233d6a10ec71de56e93a_27-Ways-to-Improve-Your-Writing-Skills-and-Escape-Content-Mediocrity-Enchanting-Marketing-2015-08-23-20-21-38.jpeg\" alt=\"27 Ways to Improve Your Writing Skills and Escape Content Mediocrity - Enchanting Marketing 2015-08-23 20-21-38\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>So why do I share this with you?Because I want you to stop worrying about what people will think or how people will respond to your content.Instead, I want you to focus on your target audience, understand their motivation and then work to capture their attention each and every day.I guarantee that this new found focus will give your audience a reason to stick around.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>No one ever said building a successful blog would be easy. In fact, it's one of the hardest things I've ever done.But I also know how incredibly rewarding it can be.Take the time to identify your purpose and commit to turning your blog into the catalyst that drives you toward your goals.  Identify your purpose and then write with conviction.Getting clear on where you're going and how you're going to get there will open up the creative flood gates and allow you to connect with your audience in a whole new way.Create a brand worth writing about and profitability will flow naturally.</p>",

Want to get more shares on social media for your business?If you're ready to beef up your social presence, asking the right questions is the answer. Why? Because they're interesting and engaging!If you're ready to speed up fan and follower growth, interaction, and engagement, let's get going.Below are the top questions you can use to boost your social media engagement and get more shares on social media!</p><h1 id=\"\">10 Types of Questions to Get More Shares on Social Media</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. True of False</h2><p>Testing your audiences knowledge about things related to your niche is a sure way to get a response.You simply make a statement, and then ask them if it’s true or false. If you’re lucky, your community will even explain their answer.</p><h3 id=\"\">Example:</h3><blockquote id=\"\">True or False: <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-voted-greatest-movie-of-all-time/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Star Wars is the greatest movie of all time</a>. (You’ll add this question to your graphic)</blockquote><p>The idea is to pick a question that’s mainstream (at least to your audience) and will draw in a large crowd.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Fill in the Blank</h2><p>Remember <a href=\"http://www.madlibs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Mad Libs</a>? I loved those as a child. Who doesn’t like to respond to a simple, but relatable question?Use this type of question across <a href=\"http://maximizesocialbusiness.com/causes-people-click-social-media-18217/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a> to offer insight into you and your business. The bonus is the insight you gain into your fans and followers.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Question: The one food I could eat every day is _________.</blockquote><p>Now frame it.</p><h3 id=\"\">For example:</h3><p>I’m a huge fan of avocados. I could eat them in just about everything and ANYTHING! Now, you tell me!</p><h4 id=\"\">Add this to your graphic:</h4><blockquote id=\"\">Fill in the blank: The one food I could eat every day is _________.</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  3. Motivational / Inspirational</h2><p>This type of question serves two purposes. First, it adds depth to your posting strategy. Rather than simply post work related content, you go deeper with your audience.Secondly, it lets your audience better understand what makes you tick.Through motivational and inspirational posts like this one from <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a>, you give your audience a more intimate view of your thoughts, processes and beliefs.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FPegFitzpatrick%2Fposts%2F1918317038281562&width=500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Experience /Relational</h2><p>This is a simple way to let your followers know you care about their opinion and share how you can solve their problem.</p><h3 id=\"\">For instance:</h3><blockquote id=\"\">“What do you LOVE most about using our product/tool, etc?”</blockquote><p>Add that question to your graphic with thoughts around why you’re asking.</p><h3 id=\"\">For example:</h3><blockquote id=\"\">“We just updated our software! Have you given it a try? Tell us what you love most!”</blockquote><p>Or take a cue from <a href=\"http://marieforleo.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Marie Forleo</a> and use this type of question in a video. She frequently asks a question her community wants answered and then provides the solution in her video. It's brilliant!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmarieforleo%2Fvideos%2F10153037145588978%2F&show_text=0&width=560\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Survey</h2><p>This is an easy way not only to <a href=\"http://maximizesocialbusiness.com/customer-experience-strategy-who-are-you-talking-to-15966/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">conduct market research</a> to improve your products and services, but also to make your audience feel they are part of the process.This in turn shows that you value their feedback. For instance, you’re designing a new look for your fragrance.</p><h3 id=\"\">Let them know what you’re up to:</h3><blockquote id=\"\">“We’re getting ready to launch our new fragrance!”</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Add your question to the graphic:</h3><blockquote id=\"\">“What should our new bottle look like?”</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  6. Provide an Update or Tip</h2><p>Share facts or updates about your industry, business or local community. You can use this type of question in a million different ways.Provide tips around your product or little known facts about your app.</p><h3 id=\"\">Here’s an example:</h3><blockquote id=\"\">“Did you know that our dishwasher not only cleans the dishes, but also cleans in half the time than anything else on the market?”</blockquote><p>I use this type of post to share a specific tip from one of my recent blog posts. It's an easy way to highlight a particular part of the article, while re-purposing the content in a fresh and new way.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/2o0A_QxrWA/\" target=\"_top\" id=\"\">Just getting started with your blog - or looking to reinvent a current one?

Fun and Frivolous</h2><p>These are fun (insert: silly) questions to pique the curiosity of your audience. The goal is to drive response and encourage interaction. Pretty simple, and looks like this question posed by Fox News LA.</p><p id=\"\">Movie tonight?

Timely</h2><p>Timely questions provide your audience with new information and give them a chance to react to it, which in turn drives engagement.They are based on what is happening right at that moment.</p><h3 id=\"\">Here’s what it could sound like:</h3><blockquote id=\"\">“Today we mark our 10-year anniversary; do you want to celebrate with us?”</blockquote><p>Now share a picture of your team celebrating or a your cake.</p><h2 id=\"\">  9. Ask for Advice</h2><p>You can begin a conversation about using your tool or product or working with your brand.These questions are perfect for engagement, because they not only offer interaction between your brand and the audience, but also between the audience itself.Take what you do and turn it into a question that lets your fans give their opinion.

Edgy or Thought Provoking</h2><p>Thought provoking questions help you learn what people think about a certain topic related to your niche.They can push buttons and encourage vibrant and interactive conversation. And as we all know — there is nothing people like more than giving their own opinion. If you’re in the education industry, you might ask:</p><blockquote id=\"\">Should cell phones be banned from classrooms?</blockquote><p>Buzzfeed has mastered this art.</p><p id=\"\">How well do you actually know the US states? <a href=\"http://t.co/lZuVNZo9UG\" id=\"\">http://t.co/lZuVNZo9UG</a></p><blockquote id=\"\">— BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/610165837824004096\" id=\"\">June 14, 2015</a></blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>The key to success in any social media platform is to interact or <a href=\"http://maximizesocialbusiness.com/social-media-writing-engagement-rules-7389/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">engage with your followers and fans</a>.<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Asking questions on social media</a> is an excellent way to get the conversation going.But you can't just ask questions.

Choose two to four colors that best reflect your brand's personality.Colors are more than just visually appealing. It's the psychology behind them that will help you craft better images.Because the reality is, <a href=\"http://thelogocompany.net/blog/infographics/psychology-color-logo-design/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">color interpretation</a> remains subjective. Your response to a specific color could be different than mine.Yet, the role it plays in purchasing and perception are significant. In a study called <a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1558119&show=abstract\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Impact of Color in Marketing<em id=\"\">,</em></a> researchers found that</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"People make up their minds within 90 seconds of an initial interaction with a product. And 62‐90% of that assessment is based on colors alone.\"</blockquote><p>So how can you use color to better inspire action, instill trust and encourage buying behavior?First, you must get inside the mind of your target market. Next,  take that information and look to the color wheel.What colors are behind some of the most successful brands and how can you tap into that emotion?</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Black</strong> conveys a message of power and authority. It speaks to a stylish and timeless message, imparting a sleek, formal, luxurious or classic experience.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Yellow </strong>is seen as fun, joyous and optimistic. Brands like Nikon, Subway and Best Buy bear the brand of a bold, deep yellow.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Orange</strong> is my brand color and one that embraces every aspect of my business. It's cheerful, inviting, encouraging, friendly and confident. Orange makes me happy!</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Red</strong> is a color that is emotionally intense. When we see red we think of “strength, adventure, energy and love.” It is extreme, exciting and vivacious with Coca Cola, Virgin and Pinterest embracing this vibrant hue.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Blue</strong> makes us think of tranquility. It promotes a feeling of calm, and can symbolize loyalty. When we think about blue, we think of the words “unique, trust, reliable or clear.” Brands prominently displaying blue within their logo are Facebook, Dell, HP and Oreo.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Green</strong> causes people to think about nature.

      "wp-content": "<p id=\"\">You’d be hard-pressed to find a person that doesn’t use some form of social media these days.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>A business’s main operative is to get more customers, and the way to do that is through advertising, so of course, they would take advantage of this free platform. Social media has therefore become a serious marketing platform for most businesses that at once thought social media was just a place for people to interact and share life moments.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>When surveyed, a whopping 96% out of more than 3700 businesses reported that they had had some presence on social media within the past five years. What does that look like for the future of social media?</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Well, to answer that, we’ll first have to look at how these marketers are using them.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>In the survey, they investigated how much the businesses were using Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, review sites, or any forums. 64% of businesses stated that they spend at least six hours a week on a social media outlet. 19% of businesses even claimed over twenty hours a week! Six hours between more than 2,000 businesses and twenty hours between more than 700 businesses can add up to a heavy social media footprint.<br>‍</p><p id=\"\">But will this presence stick around?</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Well, it was reported that 69% of these businesses claimed that social media was helping them gain loyal customers, 77% claimed it increased their traffic, and 90% claimed it increased exposure. So, you can count on this method sticking around and, even more, businesses pursuing it. As of right now, Facebook is by far the most used social media outlet, but that may change in the future.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>66% of marketers claimed that they want to increase their presence on LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube. 52% of marketers claimed they want to increase their presence on both Google+ and Instagram. 50% of marketers claimed they wanted to increase their presence on Pinterest. Less than half claimed that they wanted to increase their forum, social review, social bookmarking, vine, geo-location, or Snapchat presence.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Facebook is holding strong as the most used social media outlet, but that doesn’t mean that these sites will not be receiving heavy use as well.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>So, what are the companies putting on these social media outlets? Well, as of right now, 71% are using visuals, 70% are blogging, 57% are using videos, and 10% are making podcasts. However, despite its second-place rank, blogging was actually voted as the most important form of content by 45% of companies. Visuals, which came in as the most used form of content, were rated most important by just 34%.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Marketers want to increase all of these options across the board. When asked what form of content they would like to learn more about, 72% said videos, 69% said blogging, 68% said visuals and 43% said podcasting. You can count on all of these options increasing as well.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Businesses are even going as far as to pay for ads with companies such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and various other sites. Facebook is the most popular in this field as well, with 84% of companies using their ads. It was also reported that 53% of companies plan on increasing the amount that they use Facebook for ads.<br>However, just as with the social media presence itself, ads are projected to be used more across the board. Google ads by 38%, Twitter ads by 31%, LinkedIn by 29%, YouTube by 26%, and promoted blog posts by 24%.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Other ad options such as Pinterest, podcasts, Instagram, SlideShare, StumbleUpon, and Foursquare were reported to be increasing slightly as well.<br>So, when all is said and done, we should expect a heavier marketing lean on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, review sites, or any forums. You should expect more blogging, visuals, videos, and podcasts through the methods. You should expect more ads on sites such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Essentially, today’s social media sites are going to be playing a big role in marketing, and we should be ready for it. Facebook, especially, is and is going to remain, a big player. Most companies, 67%, did report, though, that they would not quickly adapt to a new social media outlet until it has been tried and proven to be effective.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Updated July 2020No matter the size of your company, having a business blog is essential.It keeps you in touch with customers, helps you build rapport, and boost your bottom line.Yet, many businesses struggle to build momentum and find an audience.If this is you and you're ready to build a successful business blog, learn the qualities you'll need.You'll find each of these in today's top bloggers. Here's how to incorporate them into your own blog to meet your business goals.</p><h1 id=\"\">The Most Powerful Qualities Successful Business Bloggers Share</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Responsible</h2><p>Whether you're blogging about food, health, or social media, the responsibility to your readers is still the same.Before you hit publish, review your post to ensure you maintain the integrity and credibility of your blog.How can you do this?</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Do your due diligence. Have you checked your facts, do you know if what you're sharing is 100% accurate?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't misrepresent the facts. Gaining a reputation as a writer that overly sensationalizes or promotes content that hasn't been fact-checked is not one you want to earn.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Link to any resource and properly cite anyone you've quoted. There's a very clear line between properly referencing someone else's work and stealing their ideas. Make sure you don't cross it.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't use an image if you don't have the rights. This is a big one for bloggers to clearly understand. If you're confused at all by what is ok and what's not, watch this interview with my friend Sara F. Hawkins, <a href=\"http://sarafhawkins.com/insiders-guide-proper-online-photo-use/\" id=\"\">Social Media Attorney</a> for all the answers.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnqExpmSa1k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Responsive</h2><p>Perhaps the single most important rule of business blogging is to maintain the conversation.As a blogger, you're not simply a disseminator of information. You're a teacher, a trainer and a guide.If you want to grow your blog readers and traffic, you can't ignore your readers.While this may sound like a no brainer, it can be tough to keep up with depending on the amount of conversation happening on your blog.But replying is a commitment just like any other. Don't get so caught up in creating content that you forget to thank those that support you.Your readers are the backbone of your blog and your business.  Ask for their opinion, invite feedback, ask questions, and above all, respond to comments, complaints, and concerns.If you want to see the successful use of blog commenting in action, look no further than Adrienne Smith. Adrienne has turned <a href=\"http://www.adriennesmith.net/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blog commenting</a> into art and when you look at her engagement, you can see that she's perfected it.And look at how thoughtful her responses are. So impressive!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822332a7f2818bc50d26f_blog-commenting.png\" alt=\"blog commenting\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Steadfast</h2><p>The only thing harder than starting a business blog is a sustaining one. Blogging calls for exceptional writing skills, industry expertise, and more importantly, enthusiasm about your business.It takes time, energy, and perseverance. If you want to succeed, you need to be resolute and determined.There's no doubt about it. Building a successful blog is tough work and there will be dark days. I know I've seen my fair share. The key is to keep pushing forward.[Tweet \"Building a successful blog is tough work and there will be dark days. I know I've seen my fair share. The key is to keep pushing forward.\"]</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Relevant</h2><p>You need to be relevant to your audience if you want your blog to succeed.So, how can you do that? Be passionate, stand for something, and let your blog show your human side.</p><h3 id=\"\">To do this:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Find balance in your content. You want to be professional and formal without being corporate and/or faceless.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Write a blog that adds value to your audience, but also ranks high in search based on terms/keywords relevant to your business.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Promote your products/services to your readers without sounding like a salesperson. Make your content informative and appealing.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Instead of overly praising your products/services, focus on addressing customer problems, and offer genuine advice.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Write content for the reader rather than for search engines. I know I said you want to rank based on keywords, but there's a way to do this in an organic way.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Writing for your reader should be effortless. Once you know who they are and what they need, it becomes terribly easy to create tailored content.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  5. Beneficial</h2><p>There are countless other business blogs within your niche, so what will make readers come back to yours? It's your ability to become a beneficial resource.Share insight, wisdom, and the knowledge you've gained over the years. Become the go-to resource that your readers simply cannot live without.[Tweet \"Be a benefit to others. Reciprocity is powerful when it comes from a place of gratitude.\"]</p><h3 id=\"\">How to Be Beneficial</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Inject creativity into your blog. Let your posts echo your voice.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create original content, keeping it short, and engaging.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Introduce a new theme or weekly focus.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Tell stories and use images to get your point across.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Always offer a ridiculous amount of value to your readers like Regina Anaejionu.</li></ul><p>I stumbled upon <a href=\"http://ByRegina.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">ByRegina.com</a> quite some time ago and have watched her blog explode due to the thought put into each post, graphic, and giveaway.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/0qZaWeQcjo/\" target=\"_top\" id=\"\">We're off!

Unique</h2><p>For your readers to keep coming back to your blog, it has to be refreshing and unique.Want to make that happen? Stay away from these don'ts.</p><h3 id=\"\">Don'ts of Business Blogging</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Don't bore your readers to death by over-explaining or belaboring a point.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't be stiff or unapproachable.  Your readers want to get to know you, let them.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't overshare. Try to connect with your audience on a personal level, but be reasonable in what you share both on a personal and professional level. Commit to what makes you feel comfortable.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't copy your competition. Find your own groove and work it daily.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don't simply pass along information. Share your \"why\" behind it. Why it captivated or compelled you and why your reader should care.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  7. Consistent</h2><p>It doesn't matter how often you publish a blog post. I know, I know - there's a lot that's been written and said about this topic.But I'm taking a stand here and now and telling you - stop putting on the pressure to create more content.Instead, commit to when you can post. Pick a day and then stick with it.For me, that day has been Monday's. I've been posting once a week for years and it's always on a Monday. Sure, I add a few things in here and there, but the goal is to keep my day/time consistent.Why is this important? Because you train your audience when to find you.Consistency ensures that your readers always have something new to come back to and always know when to come looking.If there are unpredictable gaps in your posts, readers may well assume you ceased blogging and leave.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Humble</h2><p>As your blog grows, there may be the inclination to feel a bit consumed by your success.I've always shied away from that, believing that my readers (and clients) success is what makes me successful.There's a fine line between promoting and bragging.If you're a braggart or too full of yourself, your audience will quickly sense that.Make your motivation about them and not you. That's what will keep them coming back for more.I've always believed this to be true. Work hard and let your success speak for itself!</p><h2 id=\"\">  9. Considerate</h2><p>And last but not least, be considerate of your community.Your blogging community – the visitors who come back to your blog consistently – they're your number one asset.Take the time to say thank you and reach out in other ways.There are many opportunities on your blog to do this,  but here are a few ideas to get you started.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Offer discounts for your products/services for anyone who visits your site more than once.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Interview readers on topics within their area of expertise.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Highlight reader content and link to their posts.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Allow readers who write within your space to guest post.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Collaborate on a project.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Offer a downloadable that's only available to subscribers.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Give away your super smarts - for FREE!</li></ul><p>There's no one that does this better than Peg Fitzpatrick. She spends her days perfecting her <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/how-to-use-pinterest-to-build-a-loyal-following-for-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media strategy</a> and then readily gives that knowledge away to her readers.Don't be afraid to do the same on your blog.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822332a7f28863f50d26e_How-to-Use-Pinterest-to-Build-a-Loyal-Following-for-your-Brand-1.png\" alt=\"How-to-Use-Pinterest-to-Build-a-Loyal-Following-for-your-Brand-1\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>There are a lot of ingredients that make up a successful blog.I don't pretend to know them all, but I can tell you that each of the \"Be's\" above has made a major impact on mine.People are looking for a leader. Be one in your industry and own your niche!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>We've all heard the adage that content is King.But, as someone marketing a business, creating content that drives ROI can feel elusive.In fact, it can feel downright impossible.Whether you're flying solo or working within a team - finding the perfect balance, rhythm and flow for your online content is crucial.So where do you begin?Last week I was honored to Keynote at the <a href=\"http://www.joinazima.org/events/become-content-marketing-powerhouse/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Arizona Interactive Marketing Association</a> where I shared:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What type of content drives ROI</li> \t<li id=\"\">How to attract the right type of customers</li> \t<li id=\"\">How to conduct relevant content marketing research</li> \t<li id=\"\">What channels work best to promote your content</li> \t<li id=\"\">What content marketing tools every digital marketer should be using</li> \t<li id=\"\">How to measure content marketing success</li></ul><p>If you've ever wanted to learn the same, then you're in luck!

It’s offering the right content to the right people with the right frequency and consistency.But it’s also relationship marketing - something many companies are still (IMHO) failing at.Many see people as numbers rather than looking at the engagement process as this:</p><blockquote id=\"\">How can I bring more food to the table then I came with?</blockquote><p>In other words, how can you become a resource so vital that the marketplace simply can’t live without your product, service or app?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822335973977619926f65_relationship-marketing-tips-1100x609.jpeg\" alt=\"relationship marketing tips\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The key to that is through the content you create.Whether it's blog posts, videos, presentations, webinars, Infographics or podcasts, your content - when shared with the right people - helps tell your story in a powerful and meaningful way.</p><h2 id=\"\">Great Companies Tell GREAT Stories</h2><p>And that's the secret great companies understand.  They know that stories can create an emotional bond with customers.Just look to brands like Apple, Coca Cola, GE, Facebook, and Disney as examples. Each one weaves storytelling into their marketing in a way that immediately connects their audience to their mission and vision.But it's not just big brands that get it's the WHY that connects people to you, not the WHAT.</p><h3 id=\"\">Stories:</h3><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Create differentiation</strong></h4><p>Look to social media marketer Peg Fitzpatrick, author of \"<a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/the-art-of-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">The Art of Social Media</a>\" and you'll see a brand that stands out from the crowd.

Define Objectives:</h2><p>What are you looking to achieve with content marketing? As Chuck Palahniuk says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.\"</blockquote><p>Grab a pen and paper or your favorite app and start writing. What are your objectives? Here's a few examples:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Raise awareness</li> \t<li id=\"\">Extend your reach</li> \t<li id=\"\">Build thought leadership</li> \t<li id=\"\">Grow your brand</li> \t<li id=\"\">Launch a product</li> \t<li id=\"\">Promote a book</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">2. Get Specific</h2><p>Now drill down into specific goals. They might look something like this:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428223359739738ec926f68_specific-social-media-goals-1100x612.png\" alt=\"specific social media goals\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">3. Do Your Research</h2><p>Who is your target market?What do they look like, do for a living and what problems do you solve?Build out your persona by looking at the data. Uncover who you're talking with and how you'll be able to help them on a daily basis. Look to this article from <a href=\"http://boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/long-live-the-user/Mulder_TheUserIsAlwaysRight_Ch3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Boxes and Arrows</a> to begin your research.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822335973973a3f926f61_build-a-brand-persona.png\" alt=\"build a brand persona\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">4. Identify Content</h2><p>What content do you currently have in place and what will you produce?To become a content marketing powerhouse, you have to create SHARE WORTHY content!Don't worry about reinventing the wheel. Begin by identifying what you have and how you can <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/repurpose-blog-content/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">repurpose</a> it for your online marketing.Then look to tools for content curation. My favorites are:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://love.postplanner.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Post Planner</a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://beta.buzzsumo.com/top-content\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Buzzsumo</a></li> \t<li id=\"\">Twitter Lists</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822335973976d40926f63_create-and-curate-1100x615.jpeg\" alt=\"create and curate\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">5. Know Your Networks</h2><p>Understand each social network: how will they support your objectives?Here's an example of what Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Plus, Pinterest and YouTube might look like for you.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282233597397fed1926f6a_understand-each-social-network-1100x592.jpeg\" alt=\"understand each social network\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">6. Commit to Consistency</h2><p>Commit to a consistent content creation and <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/effective-social-media-business-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">posting schedule</a>.Download this <a href=\"http://offers.hubspot.com/blog-editorial-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">free template</a> from Hubspot and begin to look ahead at what and when you'll share content.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282233597397612e926f62_hubspot1.png\" alt=\"hubspot1\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">7. Get Involved</h2><p>Get involved in the conversation. It's critical that if you're going to use social media, you stay interactive.And most importantly - create content that shows you're a giver, not a taker!A few of my favorite tools to make listening and injecting yourself into the conversation effortless:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Sprout Social</a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Buffer</a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://tailwindapp.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Tailwind</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"\">8. Create a System</h2><p>Now its time for you to put your content marketing into a system. The goal is to use what works best for you.While there are many tools to choose from, stick with what's easy.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Excel</li> \t<li id=\"\">Google Calendar</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://coschedule.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Co-Schedule</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"\">9. Promote Your Content</h2><p>A mistake I see many make is posting content once and then moving on.It's not enough to tweet or post once. Not only do you miss getting that content in front of a larger audience, you lose the ability to touch every single one of your fans and followers.Because let's face it - not everyone is online at the same time.<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/ways-to-promote-your-latest-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Promote</a>, promote, promote!Check out this great breakdown of how to best promote your content from <a href=\"https://www.marketo.com/_assets/uploads/2014-Sample-Social-Media-Tactical-Plan.pdf?20140609162917\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Marketo</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Create Your Daily Workflow</h2><p>What does a basic social media marketing workflow look like? Buffer has broken it down!</p><blockquote id=\"\">All that’s left to do now is synthesize this great pipeline of information you’ve created and find all the ways you can begin to act on the results you’re seeing.

Not only is it a cost-effective way to enhance your inbound marketing efforts, but it also becomes a magnet - attracting prospective clients in an organic and natural way.Whether you're looking to start a blog from scratch or reinvent your current blog, this post will walk you through the setup of a successful (and profitable) business blog.How do I know these steps will set you up for success? Because they're the exact steps I took to set up my award winning blog!Ready to get started? Read my ultimate getting started guide to building your business blog. And don't forget to leave a comment with a link to your blog.I'd love to hear (and see) how blogging is supporting your business!</p><h2 id=\"\">Is A Business Blog Really Important?</h2><p>A business blog is an essential element of your marketing strategy. And I tell you that from years of experience.I started my first blog (the very one you’re on right now) in 2004. At the time, I was in the real estate and mortgage industry and looking to make connections on a local level.But I quickly figured out the national implications as well. I began building relationships within my industry, creating connections I would have never been able to make otherwise.Many of those relationships blossomed into true friendships that I still hold dear today. Many others turned into business opportunities.Whether it's speaking at a national event or traveling as a brand ambassador, blogging has opened (and continues to open) doors for me I never thought possible.One of my most recent achievements is being named a 2015 Top 10 <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/top-10-social-media-blogs-2015-winners/\" id=\"\">Social Media Bloggers</a> by Social Media Examiner.This was a monumental moment in my blogging career and an honor that made every long, sleepless and stressful night worthwhile.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822322b8b8cfb0b47418c_ck-top-social-media-blogs-2015-480.jpeg\" alt=\"ck-top-social-media-blogs-2015-480\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>So think about it.What are you losing by not having a blog?And what could you accomplish tomorrow if you started a blog today?</p><h2 id=\"\">Benefits of a Business Blog:</h2><p>Beyond the benefits I've mentioned above, what else can a blog do for your business and personal brand?</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Improves rankings by boosting SEO</li>\t<li id=\"\">Establishes you/your business as an industry leader</li>\t<li id=\"\">Builds credibility through the know, like and trust factor</li>\t<li id=\"\">Decreases marketing costs through an integrated strategy</li>\t<li id=\"\">Allows potential customers to self-select and move through your sales funnel</li>\t<li id=\"\">Generates the right kind of leads, bringing your perfect customer to your doorstep</li></ul><h1 id=\"\">How To Build A Successful Business Blog (a Getting Started Guide)</h1><p>Now that you know the significance of a business blog, you need to learn how to build one successfully and at little or no cost.Whether you're starting from scratch or reviving an old blog, don't feel overwhelmed.I'm going to break down the exact steps you need to take to build a successful and profitable blog.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. Identify Your Topic</h2><p>Your topic is the foundation of your blog. It drives your keyword research, content, message, voice, tone and structure.But before you decide - let me offer a word of caution. Make sure your topic is something you’re passionate about.Because without passion, your blogging efforts will quickly fizzle.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Struggling to find the purpose behind your blog?  Answer a few important questions:</strong></h4><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">What drives and excites you?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Is your brand unique?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Is your message clear and powerful?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Do you have a system in place to effectively stay in front of prospects and past clients?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Is there an audience for your topic?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Is it a sustainable topic?</li></ul><p>A couple of these are soul searching, gut wrenching “why the heck do I get out of bed” questions.Take your time to answer them. Ignoring your answers is a mistake and a regret you will have down the road.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Know Your Target Market</h2><p>To attract readers and eventual subscribers to your blog, you have to speak their language. If your blog is centered around your business, this also means they'll eventually be customers or clients.Your first stop is research. You want to know what your market is looking for and then determine how to best position your content.I suggest getting crystal clear on who you're going to be talking with. Who is that reader - what do they look like, what do they do and why are they looking for your blog?With this information, you'll build out a customer or reader persona. If you haven't done this for your business, it's a great exercise to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">identify target market.</a></p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Start by identifying how you'll WIN by knowing your: Who, Issues, and Needs</strong></h4><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Who: Who will you be talking with on your blog? List your target market. Mine for example is small business owners, entrepreneurs, and marketers.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Issues: What issues is your target market dealing with? Mine would be finding enough time to manage social media, juggling a business online and offline, budget, conversion, results.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Needs: What are the needs of your target market? This is where you’ll start to identify opportunity. What problems can you solve and what solutions will you provide?</li></ul><p>Once you know your target market, writing content specifically tailored to their needs becomes terribly easy.Like this one written for <a href=\"http://www.postplanner.com/how-to-launch-pinterest-business-account-step-by-step-beginners-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Post Planner</a>. My target market is their target market - savvy business professionals using social media to market their business.It's no secret that I believe Pinterest is an amazing tool. My goal in this article was to assist marketers still struggling to understand the channel to really wrap their head around it..</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822332b8b8c41a447418d_pinterest-getting-started-guide.jpeg\" alt=\"pinterest getting started guide\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">3. Choose Your Domain, Hosting, and Theme WISELY</h2><p>Everything from your website theme, design, content and structure tells your businesses story. What story is yours telling?If it screams old, outdated and obsolete, it’s time to clean house and make a change.And when you do, make sure it’s responsive.According to <a href=\"http://blog.marginmedia.com.au/Our-Blog/bid/87385/10-Mobile-Web-Design-Statistics-All-Marketers-Should-Know-About\" id=\"\">MarginMedia</a>,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“48% of users say that if they arrive on a business site that isn’t working well on mobile, they take it as an indication of the business simply not caring.”</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Steps to getting started:</h3><ol id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Finding the right domain name is a crucial piece to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/powerful-blog-post/\" id=\"\">building a successful blog</a>. Do your research, understand the keywords people are using to find your product or service and then keep your blog and domain name consistent.</li></ol><ol start=\"2\" id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Purchase your domain and setup hosting. You don’t have to do this through the same company, but it does make setup easier.</li></ol><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Hosting is a big decision and not to be taken lightly. You have free blog hosting and paid. In my opinion, if you’re building a business blog, Wordpress (org not com) is the only way to go.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Not sure what the difference is? Here’s a nice visual breakdown from Ramsay at <a href=\"http://www.blogtyrant.com/start-a-blog-2014/\" id=\"\">BlogTyrant</a>:</li>\t<li id=\"\">I won’t go into the details of setting up hosting in this post, but will direct you to an excellent article on <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" id=\"\">Wordpress hosting options</a>.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Once you’re ready to add Wordpress to your hosting, follow their detailed instructions or hop over to my friend <a href=\"http://www.twelveskip.com/guide/blogging/944/beginners-guide-stepbystep-tutorial-to-start-your-own-blog\" id=\"\">Pauline Cabrera’s blog</a> where she walks you through the setup step-by-step.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">4. Establish Your Goals</h2><p>Like anything worthwhile, blogging will take an investment of time and energy.Before you create your business blog ask yourself why you want to start a blog, what you want to get out of it and what you want your audience to get out of it.Do you know what you’re looking to achieve with your blog?If you don’t - you're headed for failure. As with anything, if you don't know what you want to get out of it, you shouldn’t get into it.<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/profitable-blog-strategy/\" id=\"\">Now determine how often you can blog </a>and stick with it. Knowing this will allow you to stay consistent. Because consistency can be a deal killer.Think about it. When was the last time you revisited a blog that wasn’t recently updated? Probably never.Don’t shoot yourself in the foot by making this big mistake.[clickToTweet tweet=\"What doesn’t get written down doesn’t get done. Write down your blog goals to move towards success! @rebekahradice\" quote=\"What doesn’t get written down doesn’t get done. Write down your goals, identify your desired outcome and then celebrate your milestones.\"]</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Build Rapport through Relevant Content</h2><p>Once you’ve set up your blog, it’s time to start writing. Blogging about niche-specific topics is an excellent way to build rapport.Researching new trends and updates within your industry as well as community needs and market indicators will keep your name top of mind and regarded as cutting edge.Create a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/profitable-blog-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blogging strategy</a> based on current content that can be repurposed and distributed through your social channels.For example, a <strong id=\"\">blogging strategy to increase brand visibility</strong> might include:</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">A product (i.e., e-book) that you blog about and offer as a free download</li>\t<li id=\"\">Holding a contest, blogging about it and encouraging existing subscribers to help spread the word</li>\t<li id=\"\">Asking friends, family, past clients and colleagues to subscribe and provide constructive feedback</li></ul><p>The goal is to grow an audience while retaining current subscribers as faithful followers and active participants. When readers find your content to be professionally written and highly informative, they are more receptive and trusting.A <strong id=\"\">blogging strategy to help build rapport</strong> while elevating your brand might include:</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">2 blog posts per week about the latest industry information (focus on solving a problem or challenge)</li>\t<li id=\"\">A series of “how-to” posts that provide strategic ways to grow their business career field</li>\t<li id=\"\">A tutorial on how to create an effective social media strategy to increase sales conversions</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">6. Create a Regular Schedule</h2><p>The key to every successful blog is consistency. Determine how often you’ll post and what days of the week you’ll publish new articles.Creating consistency in your posting schedule does two things. It forces you to build a habit around writing - something many struggle with, especially at first - and it sets expectations for your readers.An editorial calendar will also keep you focused on your topic and posting on a regular schedule.Here's an example of an <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" id=\"\">editorial calendar</a>:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282207f47c95372d3e02d5_blog-content-calendar.jpeg\" alt=\"blog content calendar\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>From the very beginning, I chose Monday as my publish date. I knew, based on my schedule, that I could only commit to one post per week.Monday was my day, mainly because it gave me the weekend to put my post together.While there are many opinions on what day of the week is best, Monday has worked well for me.There are ways to look into your <a href=\"http://flauntyoursite.com/when-to-post-blog-to-get-more-traffic/\" id=\"\">Google Analytics to find the best times to post</a>, but this data won’t be available if your blog is new.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">To get started, answer a few questions:</strong></h3><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">How much time can you devote to writing new posts each week?</li>\t<li id=\"\">How many posts can you realistically write (and post) each week?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Will you be the only one contributing to the blog or will others be writing content?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Where will you capture content ideas -  stories, tips, answers to reader questions? I find it easiest to use Google Drive. This makes my list accessible, no matter the device.</li>\t<li id=\"\">What day of the week will you post your first article? (once the first one is live, get that day and time into your calendar. Begin to track your results in Google Analytics)</li>\t<li id=\"\">Create an editorial calendar to maintain focus and keep your blogging efforts on track. Here’s a sample and breakdown of how to best create your own.</li></ul><p>Remember: building trust doesn't’ happen overnight.  To become a trusted resource, you must establish credibility through consistently offering valuable content.Because as social media strategist<a href=\"http://www.kimgarst.com\" id=\"\"> Kim Garst</a> says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“If people like you, they’ll listen to you. But if they trust you, they’ll do business with you.”</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">7. Brand Your Business</h2><p>Have you created a consistent look, feel, message, tone and voice across your blog?</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">If not, take a moment to ensure:</strong></h4><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">You are reinforcing your business or brand mission, vision and values in every way possible</li>\t<li id=\"\">Every page, post, and image on your website has a clear call to action</li>\t<li id=\"\">You’ve eliminated distractions and allowed a crisp and clean user experience</li>\t<li id=\"\">Your languaging is natural and aligns with your overall style</li>\t<li id=\"\">The design of your website including color, scheme and fonts are consistent across all of your social networks</li>\t<li id=\"\">Your images are professional and used legally within <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2014/03/14/insiders-guide-proper-photo-usage/\" id=\"\">copyright laws</a></li></ul><p>It's no secret, my color is orange.

Build Your List</h2><p>Not building my email list. This was one of the biggest mistakes I made when initially launching my blog.I had a list I’d built within my business, but not one specifically centered around my blog. Don’t make that same mistake.If you want to get the word out about your blog, building a subscriber and email list is a great way to do it.Write amazing content that goes out to just your email subscribers. Get them excited and involved in your marketing efforts.Pat Flynn of <a href=\"http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/email-list-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Smart Passive Income</a> shares this awesome tip which I totally subscribe to (pun intended),</p><blockquote id=\"\">I use my email list like I use social media – a medium to further connect with my readers, followers and subscribers. A place to interact (<em id=\"\">gasp!</em>) and inform – not a place to promote and sell.</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">9. Promote, Promote, Promote</h2><p>Writing your latest blog post and hitting publish is just the beginning when it comes to growing your subscription base.If you truly want to<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/dominate-your-personal-brand-using-google-plus/\" id=\"\"> gain the attention</a> of your target audience (and Google), then you will need to spend time promoting your content in multiple locations.While there are many different ways to go about promoting your blog, I am going to focus on what I have found to be the most effective.Over the years I have compiled a detailed list of where, how and when to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/ways-to-promote-your-latest-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">promote your latest blog post</a>.</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Social Media</li><li>\tPost to your Facebook profile and page\t</li><li id=\"\">Post a graphic specifically designed for Google+ and then pin that graphic to Pinterest (the size that works best for me is 735 x 1200)</li><li>\t</li><li id=\"\">Create a unique graphic for Instagram and share with a short breakdown of key points</li><li>\t</li><li id=\"\">LinkedIn - share to your profile and within a group.

Start Writing</h2><p>Once you're blog is setup, you've identified your topic, purpose, audience and keywords - it's time to start writing.A question I'm often asked is, \"<a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-long-should-your-blog-posts-be-faq\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">how long should my blog post be</a>?\" There's a lot of debate around this topic, but here's my short answer.Write until you're done.That's it. Don't belabor the point or try to stuff content where it doesn't fit.When you're done sharing everything you feel is relevant, wrap it up.And listen to this advice from Kathi Kruse, Social Media Marketer and Blogger at <a href=\"http://www.krusecontrolinc.com/blog-basics-how-to-start-a-business-blog/\" id=\"\">KruseControlInc</a>. As a recovering perfectionist, I can tell you her advice is spot on.</p><blockquote id=\"\">“Don’t bother with perfection – it’s an illusion. Create something everyday, no matter whether it’s “good” or “not-so-good.” Write what you’re passionate about and edit it later.”</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">12. Never Stop Learning (and teaching)</h2><p>Write daily and know that every word better connects you to your audience.Be a student of your craft and learn from others who are succeeding within your industry or field.Then take that knowledge and make it your own, unique to you.[clickToTweet tweet=\"Never stop learning &amp; growing as a blogger.

You need an effective social media business plan!If you want to make sense of each social network, define where you show up, and how to spend your time online, this is your roadmap.While there are no one-size-fits-all solutions, you can succeed with the right plan in place.Ready to get started? Let's dive in.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Create a Social Media Business Plan?</h2><p>Lewis Carrol said,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"If <em id=\"\">you</em> don't know <em id=\"\">where you</em> are <em id=\"\">going</em>, any road will get <em id=\"\">you</em> there.\"</blockquote><p>And just as in life, the same holds true in social media.If you don't know where you're going -- you're almost surely going to get there.With a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-strategy-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media business plan</a>, you act on purpose.This customized strategy - one specific to your business - guides you towards defined goals.Not sure where to begin?Below are eleven tips to help you craft your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/small-business-strategies-to-get-noticed-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a> business plan and take full advantage of all that social media has to offer.</p><h1 id=\"\">11 Essential Elements of an Effective Social Media Business Plan</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Track Your Starting Point</h2><p>There's no way to know how far you've come if you don't know where you started.Your first step is tracking your starting point. Identify where you are today - how you appear online - and capture that in an Excel sheet, Word or Google doc.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Here are a few things you're looking for:</strong></h4><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">How often does your website show up in search? \tGo to Google and type site: <a href=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com\" id=\"\">www.yourwebsite.com</a> (replace the URL of your web site for <a href=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com\" id=\"\">www.yourwebsite.com</a>), look at the top of the page, above the search results and below the menu and you will see a count of the number of search results. Write down this number which shows how many pages from your website are indexed by Google.</li> \t<li id=\"\">How often do you show up in search? \tGo to Google and type your name in quotes. For example: “Rebekah Radice.” You're looking for an exact match. The number you see at the top is the one you want. Write it down.</li> \t<li id=\"\">How often does your company show up in search? \tGo to Google and type your company name in quotes, followed by the word \"and,\" (not in quotes), and the words city and state in quotes and separated by a comma. For example: “RadiantLA” and “Los Angeles, California.\" See the number in the top left corner and write it down.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Check sites like <a href=\"http://www.WooRank.com\" id=\"\">www.WooRank.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.SemRush.com\" id=\"\">www.SemRush.com</a> for competitive data and insight into how well your site is performing.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Go to each social network and write down the following metrics for each channel. You're tracking growth, engagement, and conversation around your brand monthly. You can do the same for any competitors you'd like to track as well.</li></ol><h3 id=\"\">Social Media Metrics to Track</h3><p>In his viral article, <a href=\"https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/social-media-marketing-success-guide-businesses/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Avinash Kaushik</a> explains the critical metrics all social marketers must track. The beauty in this is the complete obliteration of anything vanity - meaning, you will not track followers, fan numbers, or other meaningless metrics.Here's a breakdown of what you need to begin tracking today.</p><h4 id=\"\">Conversation Rate</h4><p>More than just mentions, your conversation rate helps you see the average number of comments per post in comparison to your number of followers or fans.Go to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn to get started. Write down how many comments your content received over the last week. Now divide that number by your total number of fans or followers, then multiply by 100.You can look at your posts separately or use the general metrics in your Analytics/Insight section.</p><h4 id=\"\">Amplification Rate</h4><p>Rather than looking at each share rate separately, the amplification rate takes a holistic approach.By tracking amplification, you'll see how your content is showing up across all networks.To track this, write down the number of re-pins, retweets, or shares of your content during the last week. Now divide that number by your total number of fans or followers.</p><h4 id=\"\">Applause Rate</h4><p>The applause rate helps you see what content your audience shares. The calculation is based on each post's number of \"likes\" (retweets, pins, etc.).To begin, go to each social network and write down the average number of likes per post.Now divide that number by your total number of fans or followers, then multiply by 100.The goal is to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/market-your-business-on-social-media-new-course/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">grow your online presence</a> organically through social media. The more you share content, the more you interact online, and the more your audience (and search engines) begin to take notice.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822326c28f413dfe40d4a_best-social-media-metrics.png\" alt=\"best-social-media-metrics\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">2. Know Your Audience</h2><p>Before you hop on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube or Instagram - get hyper-focused on your audience.Who is your target market? Understand their area of expertise, what they're talking about online, and how you'll use content to make a connection.You'll also want to do an online audit of your competition to see how (or if) they've reached your target audience and where opportunities still lie.The key here is to cater your content to the specific needs of your audience. Write for your reader, not you, and not based on assumptions of what you think you know.Stop trying to be everything to everyone.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Choose Your Social Network(s)</h2><p>Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram open the door to conversation.But while many believe you need to spread yourself out on each channel above, I disagree.Instead, identify where your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">target market</a> is spending time online and then master that network.Create an action plan designed with that network and audience in mind.For example, if you've decided on Pinterest - what is your audience pinning? What content can you pin to attract their attention?To get started, your plan of action might look something like this...</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Sample Action Plan: Pinterest</strong></h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Create 12 new boards with <a href=\"http://www.postplanner.com/pinterest-board-name-ideas-to-get-more-clicks-pins-followers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pinterest board names</a> based on keyword research - make them descriptive, optimized and enticing</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pin 2-3 pieces of content from blog, website, Facebook, and others on a daily basis</li> \t<li id=\"\">Follow 10 relevant people and/or brands that pin similar content</li> \t<li id=\"\">Re-pin 2-3 pieces of their content daily to increase awareness</li> \t<li id=\"\">Design or pin eye-catching images with the possibility of “going viral”</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822326c28f4bbbae40d49_pinterest-business-plan.png\" alt=\"pinterest business plan\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Be a Valuable Resource</h2><p>Want to become a valuable resource to your community?Share relevant, thoughtful, interesting and educational content - and share it often.Become a giver. This is the best way to establish thought leadership and position you as an expert within that field.As <a href=\"http://www.bryankramer.com/help-others-and-expect-nothing-in-return/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Eric L. Mitchell</a> says,D</p><blockquote id=\"\">Do we really need to be rewarded for everything? Give to give!</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">5. Monitor the Chatter</h2><p>While <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-captivating-social-media-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media is an excellent communication tool</a>, it's also an invaluable listening tool.As you listen to your customers, take time to truly hear what their needs, wants and desires are.Then work to fulfill those needs and wants with your content, time, compassion and genuine feedback.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Use tools like:</strong></h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hootsuite</a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.mention.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Mention</a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://socialmention.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Mention</a></li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822326c28f421b6e40d4b_social-mentiion.png\" alt=\"social mention monitoring\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">6. Establish Rhythm, Tone, and Voice</h2><p>To attract the right people online, you need to get real.As you begin to share content, identify how to best translate your authentic voice across social media.What does this look like?If you're playful, let that shine through. If you're serious, keep that tone in your writing.People do business with those they know, like, and trust.Trust erodes quickly when you're putting on an act and pretending to be something you're not.</p><h2 id=\"\">7. Create a Consistent Schedule</h2><p>The only way to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/solid-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">build a solid social media following</a> is to stay in the conversation.Create a schedule to consistently share and engage daily.Determine <em id=\"\">what, how, and where</em> of your social media strategy.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">How will you share?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What will you share?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Where will you share?</li></ul><p>Break this down into a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">content calendar</a> with a separate column for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Instagram, with an example of which type of media you will share.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282222a53a593f7bb36ad0_ediotrial-calendar.jpeg\" alt=\"ediotrial calendar\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">8. Use the Right Tools</h2><p>With the daily barrage of streaming content, it can feel overwhelming to keep up and manage a social media presence.That's where the right tools come in.They can take the overwhelm out of actively monitoring and engaging across various social networks.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Two of my favorites:</strong></h4><p>My daily management tool is <a href=\"http://Agorapulse.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Agorapulse.com</a>. I can listen in on a conversation (keyword monitoring), engage in the conversation, and queue my content for the best times to post.It simplifies my life and streamlines communication.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822326c28f451f4e40d4c_social-media-business-plan.png\" alt=\"social-media-business-plan\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of Pinterest. Tailwind is my go-to tool for data, analytics, and analysis.If you're spending any time on Pinterest, you need <a href=\"http://www.tailwindapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Tailwind</a>!</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">With it, you can:</strong></h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Publish content</li> \t<li id=\"\">Find relevant content to share</li> \t<li id=\"\">Identify trending pins</li> \t<li id=\"\">Check profile performance</li> \t<li id=\"\">Track popular boards and much more!</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">9. Be an Expert Networker</h2><p>Have you ever walked into a networking event and immediately started shouting details about your business? Of course not. Can you imagine what the response might be?I would think most would turn and walk away. Why? No one is interested in being sold.They want to get to know you, and they need to know that you’ve taken an interest in who they are.The problem is that most people show up on any social networking site screaming about their business.Stop showing up on social media to throw up, and instead start connecting in a meaningful (and productive) way.</p><h2 id=\"\">  10. Be a Relationship Collector</h2><p>While we don’t collect business cards online, we collect fans and followers.But what are those fans and followers worth if you're not investing in the relationship?Dr. Ivan Misner, the Founder &amp; Chairman of <a href=\"http://bni.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">BNI</a>, the world’s largest business networking organization, says you only need <strong id=\"\">four referral sources to succeed.</strong></p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Top Referral Sources</strong></h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Staff members – because no one understands your product or service better than someone who works for you</li> \t<li id=\"\">People you have given referrals to in the past</li> \t<li id=\"\">Anyone who has given you a referral in the past</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your community – people connected to you and already know, like, and trust you.</li></ul><p>Engage your top referrers and help them share your story. There’s nothing better than a third-party referral that can edify you and your business.Make a commitment to <strong id=\"\">stop collecting, and start contributing</strong>. It’s the relationships, not the numbers, that matter.</p><h2 id=\"\">11. Track, Measure and Adjust</h2><p>Are you wishing for social media success, or are you planning for it?Put a plan in place that allows you to track, measure, and assess your results.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">An example of metrics to track:</strong></h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Traffic referrals from each social network</li> \t<li id=\"\">Leads from social channels to a specific landing page</li> \t<li id=\"\">Engagement across social media - retweets, comments, likes</li> \t<li id=\"\">Social media audience/community growth</li> \t<li id=\"\">New blog subscribers</li></ul><p>Once you've implemented a system to measure your success, you now need to analyze your progress.Identify what is working and adjust what is not. A successful social media strategy is agile.</p><h2 id=\"\">BONUS: Get Blogging</h2><p>Social media can be an enormous boost to online credibility, but it cannot replace <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/start-a-successful-blog-in-7-easy-steps/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">the value a blog brings to your business</a> and personal brand.It should be part of an integrated marketing plan.

Wrong!That cookie-cutter message doesn't say anything about who you are or why you want to connect.  Spend a few moments scripting out a short, personalized message.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Here are a couple of examples:</strong></h4><p><em id=\"\">Hi Donna,I have been a long-time fan of your blog and appreciate your valuable insight around the ______ industry.

Know Your Goals</h2><p><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Define your goals</a> and then put them in writing. As Dr. Gail Matthews, a psychology professor at Dominican University in California, found writing down your goals makes a significant difference.In a goal-setting study that included 267 participants, Dr. Matthews found that,</p><blockquote id=\"\">Those who wrote down their goals were 42 percent more likely to achieve them.</blockquote><p>Who wouldn't want those odds, especially when building your business?If you want to get clear about your goals, answer these questions first.</p><h4 id=\"\">Goal-Setting Questions</h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What type of social media followers/fans do you want?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What makes you unique? Translate that into your social media profiles.

Will you need to outsource to a company or virtual assistant?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What results are you hoping to achieve? (increased exposure, leads, traffic)</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">2. Listen and Respond</h2><p>As you begin to venture into social media, making new connections is critical to your online health.Begin by listening to what is being said in and around your industry or niche. Pay attention to what the needs of your potential clients are.Then begin to join in the conversation. The only way you can <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/small-business-tactics-for-better-social-media-connections/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create meaningful relationships</a> is to engage consistently.And I don't mean talking \"at\" people. Instead, talk \"with\" the community you're building. They're real people that need to know you value their opinion.Ask questions, and then listen to the response.. Focus on what is important to them and then share content that meets a need or solves a problem.Someone who shines when it comes to knowing and understanding her audience is <a href=\"http://kimgarst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Kim Garst</a>. Watch how Kim interacts with her fans and followers.Do you see the difference between someone who's actively participating and someone who is simply blasting a message?

Build Relationships, Don’t Just Collect Numbers</h2><p>This one falls in line with the last. As you start to share content across your social media platforms, focus on building relationships.If you constantly send out boring data or confusing statistics, but you don’t talk and engage with the people in a meaningful way -- you've shot yourself in the foot.Basically, you're talking to a brick wall.It is considered poor<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-etiquette-business/\" id=\"\"> social media etiquette</a> if you don't interact. Stop shouting at your fans and followers and get into the conversation.I’m always impressed with the team at <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Sprout Social</a>.

Post Consistently</h2><p>Your updates on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, LinkedIn, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-instagram-to-expand-business-reach/\" id=\"\">Instagram</a> and Pinterest need to be hyper-focused on your target market.They also need to happen on a consistent basis. Create a schedule that easily works into your day.Tools like <a href=\"http://buffer.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Buffer</a> can help you manage your content and share without fail. Then integrate your account with tools like <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">IFTTT</a> (If This Then That) to create rules for specific actions.For example, every time I post a new article, the link is sent to my Buffer account and scheduled to tweet.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282231bde7a76d1483d08c_buffer-.png\" alt=\"buffer\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>And as you choose content to share, remember to mix it up.Include your content, other peoples content, business related posts, quotes and other topics that will capture the attention of your potential audience.Simply posting industry content isn't appealing day in and day out.Give insight into who you are and what your business stands for. Have fun, be valuable and stay relevant.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Be Visual</h2><p>We live in a visual online world. From Facebook to Instagram, eye-catching images are the order of the day.As my friend Neal Shaffer with <a href=\"http://maximizeyoursocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Maximize Your Social</a> says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">Visuals appear prominently in news feeds of social networks, so take a visual approach to not only posting information, but to communicating as well. Combine this with your own unique branding and perspective, and you’re bound to stand out in this noisy social media world of ours. (via <a href=\"http://www.postplanner.com/small-business-tips-for-standing-out-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">PostPlanner</a>)</blockquote><p>How can you do this? Grab quotes from your latest article and add them to Facebook and Google Plus. Then pin it on Pinterest and share on Instagram.Give your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/grow-social-media-audience-communities/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">target audience</a> a visual experience that allows for unique insight and awareness around your business and brand.<em id=\"\">Remember:</em> This is not about being spammy and shoving your product or service down their throat.It's about offering valuable insight in a highly-shareable format.Want an example of this in action?

Get Local and Get Found</h2><p>Concentrate on building your social media networks with people in your service area or community.The more locally involved you get, the more interactive you are with people in your local space, the greater possibility the leads and potential buyers will come to you.A surefire way to get your content in front of the right people? Use hashtags!Use a tool like <a href=\"http://hashtags.org\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">hashtags.org</a> to identify which hashtags within your local area get the most traction. Once you've identified the top two or three, start using them in your tweets and posts.Someone who knows her market is Jodi Okun. Jodi is a <a href=\"collegefinancialaidadvisors.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">College Financial Aid Advisor</a> and frequently uses hashtags in her tweets.Jodi knows that using those hashtags over and over builds credibility and helps potential clients take notice.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Financial Aid Award Letters <a href=\"http://t.co/7neLnWAKaU\" id=\"\">http://t.co/7neLnWAKaU</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CollegeCash?src=hash\" id=\"\">#CollegeCash</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmarterStudents?src=hash\" id=\"\">#SmarterStudents</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/pfeA4c77Ne\" id=\"\">pic.twitter.com/pfeA4c77Ne</a> — Jodi Okun (@JodiOkun) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JodiOkun/status/577235343386091520\" id=\"\">March 15, 2015</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">7. Stop Selling and Start Sharing</h2><p>Don't sell yourself before you know someone. People want to get to know you.They want to find a commonality -- it could be as simple as you both live in the same city.It might be that you both have a dog, or that you have both eaten at the local ice cream shop.Build on these things. The very best thing that happens within <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-idea-formulas-and-shortcuts-for-improvement/\" id=\"\">online networking circles</a> is when someone else shares a link of one of your posts.It's more important to converse with others than to simply spam their social media feeds with uninteresting content.</p><h4 id=\"\">Your posted content should look something like this:</h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">20% linking to your content</li> \t<li id=\"\">20% linking to other people’s content (A local sports team, restaurant, school district, government office, local blogger, reciprocal linking, etc.)</li> \t<li id=\"\">20% other business talk</li> \t<li id=\"\">40% personal talk and networking (Ask how your followers’ animals/kids are!

      "wp-content": "<p>Creating a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-presence/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">successful social media presence</a> is one of the most important elements to branding your business online.As recent statistics show, social networking is now the <a href=\"http://www.go-gulf.ae/blog/businesses-social-media/\" id=\"\">top online activity</a> in the U.S. With users spending more than 37 minutes per day on social media, making quality connections is more important than ever before.But it's not just the amount of time spent on social media.  It's the fact that 46% of users say they’re actively looking to make a purchase.Those statistics drive home what you already know.Knowing how to <strong id=\"\">effectively position your business online</strong> isn’t just good business, but a must for continued success.If you’re struggling to create a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/master-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">strategic social media presence</a> – one that allows you to maximize your online marketing efforts – follow the 47 social media ideas, formulas and shortcuts below for instant improvement!</p><h1 id=\"\">47 Social Media Ideas, Formulas and Shortcuts to Kickstart Your Business</h1><h2 id=\"\">Facebook</h2><p>1. Write down your goals. Are they still the same as when you started your Facebook Page? If not, you need to adjust your strategy. Identify your goals and the tactics that will push you towards them on a daily basis.2. Update your profile. This includes your about, long and short bio, company contact information and web address.3. Add your <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/badges/\" id=\"\">Facebook badge</a> to your website and/or blog to allow visitors an easy way to connect with your page.4. Freshen up your page with a new cover photo. If you haven’t changed your Facebook cover since you started your page, you’re missing a big marketing opportunity. Use your cover to tell your story, share your latest product/service or to promote an upcoming event.The key here is to ALWAYS include a call to action. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WendyJMcClelland\" id=\"\">Wendy McClelland</a> is a great example of Facebook cover photo designed to convert. How can you use this idea on your business page?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282231a53a590419b36bf6_wendy-mcclelland.jpeg\" alt=\"wendy mcclelland\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>5. Promote your Facebook Page (and all social networks) through your email signature If you’re a Gmail user, try <a href=\"http://www.wisestamp.com/\" id=\"\">Wisestamp</a>.6. Create a daily plan of action:</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Visit 5 Facebook pages to comment, LIKE, interact and engage</li>\t<li id=\"\">Follow 5 new relevant pages</li>\t<li id=\"\">Boost a post and target relevant competitor pages to increase reach and grow your fan base</li>\t<li id=\"\">Post 1-2 times per day (at a minimum)</li>\t<li id=\"\">Respond to all timeline posts, questions and comments</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Google Plus</h2><p>7. Now that you’ve updated your Facebook cover, do the same for Google Plus. Keep it consistent with the same look and feel.8. Create graphics specifically designed for Google Plus. Pinterest has made an art out of transforming images into gorgeous eye-candy. <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/google-plus-vs-facebook/\" id=\"\">Google+</a> offers a similar visual appeal. I have found that images anywhere from 600 x 900 to 800 x 1200 perform best. Those sizes can then be pinned to Pinterest for cross-promotion.9. Post high-quality content often and always include a call to action. What is the next step you want your followers to take – click, read, buy – tell them!10. <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/dominate-your-personal-brand-using-google-plus/\" id=\"\">Optimize your Google Plus profile</a> for maximum reach.</p><h3 id=\"\">A few ways to optimize your profile:</h3><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Write your summary using information about you and your business that will connect with those looking for your product or service. Make sure this includes your passion and hobbies that fall outside of your “job.” Conversations happen when you share interesting facts and tidbits about yourself.</li>\t<li id=\"\">A professional profile image – Your profile image should be considered a key element to your personal brand. For this reason, it is extremely important that you create consistency from one network to the next by using the same high-quality professional headshot.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Use relevant keywords – Do you know what search terms people are using when looking for your business? Google is eager to tell your story, but without your keywords you could create a situation where consumers have to hunt and peck to find you.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Get local – As you craft your summary, remember to add your industry specific keywords as well as your location-based keywords including city and state.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Twitter</h2><p>11. You now have an updated Facebook and Google Plus cover, take that and translate it to Twitter. Each social network has dimensions specific to that channel. Grab the complete list of dimensions in my post, “<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-image-sizes/\" id=\"\">The Essential Cheat Sheet for Social Media Image Sizes</a>.”12. Grow your following on a daily basis. Identify who your perfect follower is and then connect with them through a tool like <a href=\"http://twellow.com\" id=\"\">Twellow</a>.13. Write content relevant to your audience and test what tweets perform best. Which ones receive the most retweets or comments? Find a commonality in what works and then rinse and repeat.14. Stay active and engaged by using a listening and monitoring tool. Track your mentions, keywords and hashtags with tools like <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com\" id=\"\">Sprout Social</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Hootsuite </strong></a>and <a href=\"http://simplymeasured.com\" id=\"\">Simply Measured</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">LinkedIn</h2><p>15. Update your profile adding any new employment, skills, testimonials, articles, presentations or schooling. Make sure it’s100% complete.16. Take time to endorse people you’ve worked with based on skill and industry.17. Get involved in relevant groups and begin to participate in active conversations. Not sure where to find <a href=\"http://topdogsocialmedia.com/linkedin-groups-with-targeted-prospects/\" id=\"\">LinkedIn groups within your industry or niche</a>? Take this tip form Melonie Dodaro with Top Dog Social Media.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Once you’ve found a “perfect prospect”, look at the groups they are a member of. This is where I have found the absolute best groups that I simply never would have thought of on my own. When you identify someone that seems like a perfect prospect, look at their profile and see which groups they have joined.</blockquote><p>18. Share content that’s interesting to the group and like or comment on others content.19. Add a <a href=\"https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49960/~/adding-or-changing-the-background-photo-on-your-profile\" id=\"\">LinkedIn background image</a> to your profile. This is another way to rand your business and creates the same marketing opportunity s Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter cover images.An example of seamless branding is Viveka Von Rosen with <a href=\"http://linkedintobusiness.com/\" id=\"\">Linked Into Business</a>. Her LinkedIn cover is a perfect complement to her website and other social networks. Plus, take a look at how easy she’s made it to contact her. Pretty smart, right?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282231a53a597b12b36bf7_viveka-von-rosen-1100x382.jpeg\" alt=\"viveka von rosen\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Instagram</h2><p>20. Update your bio. Just like any other social media “about” or bio, it’s wise to freshen things up every once in a while.21. Add your website to your <a href=\"http://instagram.com/rebekahradice\" id=\"\">Instagram profile</a>and share the fact that you’re now on Instagram with your other social networks. Your friends, fans and followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Google Plus need to know about your Instagram profile.22. Research hashtags and find those specific to your local area or industry. Use them in each of your posts to make your content “searchable.” It will also allow those looking to connect to easily find you.23. Create images that immediately connect people to your brand. Your Instagram account should be an extension of everything else you do online. Just look to Peg Fitzpatrick’s account and you’ll see her signature pink and circular logo across everything she posts.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282231a53a59dc0fb36bf5_peg-fitzpatrick-700x998.jpeg\" alt=\"peg fitzpatrick\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Pinterest</h2><p>24. Complete your profile on Pinterest and optimize it for search. Add keywords that best define and describe your business.25. Setup 5 <a href=\"http://www.postplanner.com/pinterest-board-name-ideas-to-get-more-clicks-pins-followers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">boards based on your keywords</a> and pin 5 pieces of content to each.26. Use <a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/articles/guided-search#Web\" id=\"\">Pinterest Guided Search</a> to find people to follow or content to pin based on keywords or phrases.27. Add <a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/articles/enable-rich-pins-your-site\" id=\"\">Pinterest Rich Pins</a> to add additional Meta data to any content pinned from your website or blog.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bbde7a7b1d783d00d_pinterest-social-media-search.png\" alt=\"pinterest-social-media-search\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>28. <a href=\"https://business.pinterest.com/en/verify-your-website\" id=\"\">Verify your website</a>. This is a big credibility booster!29. Connect your Twitter and Facebook accounts to Pinterest.30. Join Facebook groups or other online groups where members share tips and tricks that can help you promote business. An excellent group (and chat) to join is Kelly Lieberman’s #Pinchat.</p><h2 id=\"\">Website/Blog</h2><p>You might wonder what your website and blog have to do with your social media presence. To that I would answer: everything.Your website is the first thing many people will see when researching you or your business. When they land on your site, what do they see?If you want to increase credibility, visibility, traffic and social shares – it’s time to make a few improvements.</p><h2 id=\"\">Website Content</h2><p>When was the last time you updated your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/instantly-improve-website-credibility/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">website content</a>? There’s no time like the present!</p><h4 id=\"\">Here’s a quick checklist to get you started:</h4><p>31. Review each page of your website and update or remove any outdated content.32. Read through each page and identify any grammatical errors. Take your time to go line by line, and if this isn’t something you enjoy – or feel equipped to do – give it away to someone that’s capable. I can’t stress enough how important this step is. Believe me when I say -- misspellings and inaccuracies are an instant credibility killer.33. Have you received recent testimonials? Get those added to your “About” page.34. Do you regularly conduct case studies? Add those to your product or services page.35. Make your content easy to read and understand. Clean up anything that feels too long or belabors a point. Your readers are scanning in a matter of seconds. If you don’t make your content clear and concise, they’ll move on before you get the chance to capture their attention.36. Evaluate the copy on any sales or landing pages. Is it up-to-date and current? Are pricing, descriptions and graphics accurate?</p><h2 id=\"\">SEO</h2><p>37. Take a look at your on-page optimization. Start with an audit by using a tool like <a href=\"https://marketing.grader.com/\" id=\"\">Hubspot’s Marketing Grader</a>.38. What keywords are people typing into search engines when looking for your business, product or service? Use Google’s <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\" id=\"\">Keyword Planner</a> to research terms that can lead potential clients to your website.39. Create a content strategy that includes your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/improve-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media strategy</a> and supports your Social Media Optimization and Search Engine Optimization strategies.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822080da44933edf20bd1_social-media-strategy-template.jpeg\" alt=\"social media strategy template sample\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Blog</h2><p>40. There’s nothing worse than a stale blog that appears abandoned. Determine how often you will post and then add that to your content strategy to keep your posting consistent.41. Update all WordPress plugin and any theme updates. Also ensure that you’re using an SEO plugin. My recommendation is <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/\" id=\"\">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> – it’s a simple way to optimize every aspect of your WordPress site.42. Always add your keywords within your blog post headline, h1 to h6 tags and body. These should be consistent with the keywords you chose when originally setting up your website and blog.</p><h2 id=\"\">Website and Blog</h2><p>43. Review your contact forms. Is it easy to get in touch with you? Determine whether your message moves potential clients through the buying cycle.44. Is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\" id=\"\">Google analytics</a> installed and properly configured?45. Check for any broken links (and fix them!)46. Update images and make sure all posts have a “pinnable” Pinterest image.47. Plan to review and analyze your Google Analytics and shared statistics regularly.</p><h3 id=\"\"> Final Thoughts</h3><p>This checklist is only the beginning. Take each step and add it into your overall marketing strategy.Daily steps are the key to getting your social media presence into tip-top shape!</p>",

Create a Cross- Platform Strategy</h2><p>The most successful companies leveraging social media are expanding their influence to several platforms.To gain exposure and traction, create an <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/increase-social-media-results/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">integrated social media strategy</a>.This is one that combines multiple social media platforms, leveraging each one in a specific way.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822305c4c4c73e240fe50_cross-platform-strategy-700x395.jpeg\" alt=\"cross platform strategy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">4. Keep Your Branding Consistent</h2><p>When people land on your social networks, do they know it's you?As you set up accounts on different social media networks, ensure your logo, color scheme, fonts, and graphics are consistent.Whether it's a branded Facebook cover or your Twitter profile picture, your look, feel, and message should be easy to identify.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822305c4c4c52ff40fe3d_consistent-branding-700x393.jpeg\" alt=\"consistent branding\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Mix It Up</h2><p>Are you posting the same content, in the same way, day in and day out? STOP!Don’t just stick with the same old “picture with a caption” format. Test questions, large images, links to articles, and videos. Just as you're not one-dimensional, neither is your audience.Get creative!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822305c4c4c77fd40fe4d_mix-it-up-700x390.jpeg\" alt=\"mix it up\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">6.

Follow the 70-30 Rule</h2><p>The 70-30 rule follows this strategy: maintain seventy percent engaging, interactive, and entertaining content and thirty percent promotional.Is this a hard and fast rule? No.What it is is an easy way to audit your current content. How often are you posting or tweeting self-promotional information?Maintain a high content value strategy and always monitor your target market. Before you post, ask -- is this relevant, timely, or beneficial?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822305c4c4c11b640fe4f_content-strategy-700x391.png\" alt=\"content strategy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">8.

It’s important to leverage that content in a whole new way.</p><h3 id=\"\">STEP 2: Brainstorm Ideas</h3><h2 id=\"\">  1. Spotlight an Event on Social Media</h2><p>Did you recently attend an event or online conference and share takeaways on your blog? Take that conversation and dissect it.Each highlight and insight from your article will break down into new, separate <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/4-easy-ways-to-make-the-most-of-your-social-media-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media posts</a>.What would be helpful to your community and what would they find interesting?</p><h3 id=\"\">Two easy ways to use this:</h3><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Give your community a deeper look behind the scenes of your business or industry.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Offer your thoughts on why this event was so important and why the information shared should matter to potential clients.</li></ol><h2 id=\"\">  2. Provide a Video Tip Series</h2><p>Take a popular blog post and break it down into multiple video tips.For example, you wrote an article on the “Top 10 Ways to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/using-video-to-market-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Use Video Marketing in Your Small Business</a>.” Take each tip and create short video tips around them.Post these to YouTube, create a new blog article based on the video, and share to your social networks.

Now, answer those questions.Once you've written the blog post it's time to turn one Q &amp; A into a pin for Pinterest. Create a <a href=\"http://www.postplanner.com/pinterest-board-name-ideas-to-get-more-clicks-pins-followers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">new Pinterest board</a> and start a series dedicated to these tips.<a href=\"http://constantcontact.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Constant Contact</a> is a company that consistently repurposes content.

Design an Infographic</h2><p>Want to capture the attention of your online audience? Incorporate Infographics!Donna Moritz is an excellent example of repurposing at work. She writes a post and then turns that post into additional media.Her <a href=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/how-to-use-snackable-visual-content-on-your-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Infographics</a> become shared content across all of her social sites and yet another way for her fans, followers and blog subscribers to support her through social shares.Plus, they're super eye-catching!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822306c28f45bf3e40d1a_snackable-content-539x1100.jpeg\" alt=\"snackable content\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  7. Tell a Bigger Story</h2><p>Are you sharing customer stories? If not, you should be. It's a great way to explain how you solve customer problems, while sharing the successes of your clientele.Highlight your clients (with their permission of course) in a blog post and then create testimonial graphics that can be shared on any of your social networks.Testimonials are powerful. In fact, in a survey by <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/survey-customers-more-frustrated-by-how-long-it-takes-to-resolve-a-customer-service-issue-than-the-resolution-38756\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Dimensional Research</a>, 90 percent of respondents said online reviews had a positive impact on their buying decision.Just think about how that might benefit your business.</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Turn Blog Content Into a Slideshare</h2><p>Take your blog post and turn it into a presentation and then post it on <a href=\"http://slideshare.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Slideshare</a>. You can also give that content a one-two punch by writing a new blog article and reposting the content along with the embedded Slideshare.<a href=\"http://www.haikudeck.com/\" id=\"\">Haiku Deck</a>, which is now integrated into Slideshare, is one of my favorite ways to convert an article into a visually appealing slide deck. Incredibly intuitive, Haiku Deck will save you a significant amount of time and allow you to create stunning, image-rich slideshows that stand out.Here's an example of how to make this work. This slide deck was repurposed from Peg Fitzpatrick's article, \"<a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/how-to-connect-with-your-customers-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">How to Connect with Your Customers on Social Media</a>.\"Peg broke down each step into a PowerPoint and then uploaded and shared to Slideshare, putting her content in front of a whole new group of people.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/28334621\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"\">  9. Schedule a Webinar</h2><p>Whether it is you on screen or a screencast of your latest PowerPoint, connecting with your audience through video is crucial.Take your blog post and break it down into a free, educational webinar.A free program to create and share your content is <a href=\"https://www.screenr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Screenr</a>. Just click “record now” and within seconds you are recording anything you can see on your screen.Another easy way to create a webinar is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google Hangouts</a>. Create an event and broadcast your Hangout live with Hangouts on Air. Want to see how it's done?Jeff Sieh and his \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJeffSieh\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Manly Pinterest Tips</a>\" show proves that you can successfully integrate Hangouts and video into an overall marketing strategy.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MeKWuR0jWYE?list=PLm1J5b95Cb3ZyDw-Ij6Hw-YxJU-l5-au_\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  10. Make a Roundup Post</h2><p>This idea is easy to implement and takes very little time to put together.</p><h3 id=\"\">Here is how it's done:</h3><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Create a new blog post that highlights previous articles that readers might have missed</li> \t<li id=\"\">Go back through your most recent articles and write short snippets around each post</li> \t<li id=\"\">Link to a select group of your top posts and watch them take on a whole new life</li></ol><h2 id=\"\">  11. Online Course</h2><p>Once you have been writing for a while it's easy to see the massive amount of content you've amassed. Take that content, consolidate it, and then share your knowledge in an online course.As <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/repurpose-your-content/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Coschedule</a> says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">Online learning is a growing trend, and there are lot of sites popping up that will help you find a new home for the content you’ve worked so hard to create. Use a tool like Skillshare, an online learning community where the world’s best experts teach real-world skills. Anyone can <a href=\"http://www.skillshare.com/teach\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">apply to become a teacher</a> on Skillshare.

      "wp-content": "<p>Facebook mistakes. Your small business has made them. Whether it’s an unintentional post or an inappropriate comment, mistakes will happen.Especially in an environment where content is being shared at lightning speed.However, some of the worst <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/6-facebook-mistakes-killing-your-page/\" id=\"\">Facebook mistakes</a> are the ones that often go unnoticed. They’re the missed opportunities. The chance for increased engagement, interaction and shares.While Facebook continues to change the rules, you must make the most of every opportunity. No matter if it’s missing content, a lack of strategy or an obsolete bio, mistakes are made and prospects lost.So, what mistakes are you making and how can you fix them?Here are some of the top <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/small-business-strategies-to-get-noticed-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook mistakes small businesses make</a> and what you should do instead.</p><h1 id=\"\">Facebook Mistakes Small Businesses Make</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1.  Not Completing “About” Info</h2><p>Don’t underestimate the power of the “About” section within your Facebook page.Just like the “About” page on your blog, this area within your <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rebekahradicellc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook page</a> is one of the top places fans will visit.As they land on your page - eager to discover what you’re all about and what they can expect - ensure those details are front and center.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822302b8b8c41e147417e_facebook-about-tips.jpeg\" alt=\"facebook about tips\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Tips to Help You Craft Your “About”</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Add your mission, vision and values along with any founding details that would matter to potential clients.</li> \t<li id=\"\">You have a short amount of time to gain the attention of potential fans. Put the most relevant details at the top of your “About.”</li> \t<li id=\"\">Answer questions any customer or fan would have. (e.g. how long have you been serving the community)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Provide success stories and examples of how you’ve helped others. Was there a difficult situation you were able to work through? Highlight that story!</li> \t<li id=\"\">Strike industry jargon from your your messaging and talk to consumers in a conversational way.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Add keywords and phrases that are relevant to your business and would be used by any consumer looking for your small business.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  2. Posting Only One Type of Content</h2><p>Would you be able to tell your story through a simple status update? Probably not.Graphics, video and links all play a huge role in describing what you do and how you help, so don't forget to change things up.And keep in mind, not everyone consumes content the same way. Using multiple media types allows you to reach a new audience and keep your fans excited to come back for more.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marieforleo\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Marie Forleo</a> actively uses video to engage her audience. Marie's short videos are personable, funny, and always loaded with tips to improve your business.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Ever struggle with staying present while still planning for the future?

Not Using Facebook Insights</h2><p>If you have a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rebekahradicellc\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook Page</a> and don't check your stats, then you’re missing out on a lot of useful information.Initially, what you’re looking for are audience statistics, such as age, gender and country of residence.Now, take it a step further and look at total interactions and interactions per post.Check <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/159526011777637867/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">what time is best to post</a> and what type of content receives the most engagement.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822302b8b8cf20147417c_time-to-post-on-facebook.png\" alt=\"time to post on facebook\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Cover Photo</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/set-up-your-facebook-page/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook cover photo</a> works as an online billboard. You have the chance to immediately convey the details about your company to anyone landing on your page.Let your Facebook cover photo make a strong visual impact.  Use this space to tell your story, sharing details that allow potential clients to understand the what and why behind your business, not just the how.Too often, the cover photo is mistaken as a spammy marketing tool. While Facebook has significantly relaxed their <a href=\"www.facebook.com/help/search/?q=cover+guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">cover guidelines,</a> you still want to steer clear of anything that reeks of over-promotional.Look to Peg Fitzpatrick's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pegfitzpatrick.author?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook cover</a> as an excellent example. She changes it out frequently, keeping it fresh, interesting and always on brand.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822302b8b8ccec047417d_peg-fitzpatrick-facebook.jpeg\" alt=\"peg fitzpatrick facebook\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">What to Do to Increase Facebook Engagement</h2><h2 id=\"\">1. Create a Memorable Brand</h2><p>What sets you apart from your competition? Are you clear on who you help and how you help them? Do you know what problems your company solves?In order to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/being-unforgettable-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create a memorable brand </a>and outshine your competition online, you must clearly articulate your value.Your company has an amazing opportunity to translate what you do offline to online. Don’t fall flat by misunderstanding the medium.Share your history, unique abilities and commitment to your community. Tell your story in a real and authentic way that resonates with anyone looking to connect and hire or purchase from you.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Share Consistent Content</h2><p>Creating, curating and sharing consistent content within Facebook updates can be a challenge.  In fact, one of the top questions I receive from companies across the country is content related.</p><h4 id=\"\">Have you often wondered:</h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Where to find top content?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What you should be talking about?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How long you should spend writing Facebook content?</li></ul><p>If so, you’re not alone. But, there’s good news. I’m going to demystify how social media managers find content on a daily basis.I’m also going to give you a few ideas on where you might have content hiding.</p><h3 id=\"\">Where to Find Content</h3><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Use an RSS reader such as Feedly to consolidate all of your favorite bloggers.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Set up Google Alerts with queries such as “social media news” or “blogging tips.”</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create a folder or use bookmarks to collect your favorite Facebook pages. Keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening within your industry.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pay attention to what your competition is talking about. Is it a hot topic? Share that story and put your own unique spin on it.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share celebration, behind-the-scenes, convention or speaking photos.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Post your “customer of the week” photo and offer a mini bio and background congratulating the team member on their excellent work.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share your latest blog post with a link back to your blog.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Already shared your latest blog post? Pull a quote from that post and turn it into a graphic with a tool like Canva.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Talk about an upcoming event you are promoting or a local charity that you support.</li></ol><p>As you can see, you are only limited by your creativity.Look at your past marketing collateral and determine what you can share that transfers your mission, values and vision to your Facebook fans.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Build a Strong Community Culture</h2><p>Use your Facebook page to clearly express your company culture.Share <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/outshine-competition-online/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">what makes you stand out</a> and what matters most to you both internally as well as externally.Post pictures and videos from local events, office parties and your charity work. People love to see behind-the-scenes.Take Southwest Airlines for example.Their company culture extends well beyond the typical airplane flight. You see it in everything they do and reflected in each of their employees.</p><blockquote id=\"\">From an empty gray concrete slab to an active, colorful community hub. This #EarthDay is about the Heart of the Community: http://social.southwest.com/qLIPosted by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Southwest\" id=\"\">Southwest Airlines</a> on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Southwest/posts/10153389507563949\" id=\"\">Wednesday, April 22, 2015</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\">4. Have a Clear Call to Action</h2><p>A call to action isn’t just for your marketing material. You need to use it within your Facebook posts as well. For example, you’re sharing your latest blog post titled, “5 Mistakes Every Blogger Makes and How to Avoid Them.”<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rebekahradicellc/posts/10152755602517233\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Share your article on Facebook</a> with copy such as, “Are you a new blogger?” or “Just getting your new blog started” and then tell them how you will solve their problem.It might look something like this,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“Starting a new blog? How You Can Avoid Mistakes Every Blogger Makes!” Click here to see which ones we see more often than not and find out what you can do to avoid them.”</blockquote><p>Other clear calls to action are: “find out more,” “click here for more details,” “don’t miss this tip,” or“watch this video for more details.”The bottom line is this; you never want your fans to guess what the next step is. Be crystal clear in what you want them to do. Whether it’s click, share or comment; spell it out.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>Take a moment to think about why your prospects or past clients use Facebook?Do they want to connect and engage or are they looking to be heard? Do they need support or is it the answers to their most frequently asked questions they crave?My guess is that it’s a mixture of all of the above.Give your community a virtual water cooler where they can gather, interact and share stories on a daily basis.Make your Facebook page the go-to location for your industry or niche!</p><h6 id=\"\"><a href=\"http://maximizesocialbusiness.com/facebook-mistakes-real-estate-brokerage-making-15082/\" id=\"\">Written by Rebekah Radice and originally posted on Maximize Social.</a></h6>",

Optimize Your Bio</h2><p>There are many ways to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/optimize-new-twitter-profile/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">optimize your profile</a>, but the main one we are going to focus on is your bio or the “about” section. Your bio is the first thing anyone visiting your profile will read when deciding whether or not they want to follow you.It's important that you take time to craft your bio, including essential details about your business, background and career highlights.</p><h3 id=\"\">Bio Tips:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">You have 160 characters of space as opposed to the 140 you are limited to in a tweet.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Remember: People connect with human beings, so make sure your bio is relatable and approachable.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share the details that make you unique. Help others feel like they know you as this will result in deeper conversations with like-minded individuals.</li> \t<li id=\"\">The words you use in your bio are searchable keywords, so keep them specific to what potential clients are looking for when researching your business. (e.g. your hometown, niche, industry or company name)</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RayHiltz\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Ray Hiltz </a>is an example of a bio that's straightforward and concise, clearly expressing what he does and how he helps potential clients.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222f59739784ff926f4c_ray-hiltz.jpeg\" alt=\"ray hiltz\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Use Twitter Lists</h2><p>Do you feel overwhelmed by the amount of information coming at you on Twitter? Get organized with <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-using-twitter-lists\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Twitter lists</a>.Not only are they a simple solution to controlling your Twitter stream, but also a great way to consolidate your followers. Lists let you group your followers together based on a common theme, interest or industry.</p><h4 id=\"\">For example, you could create lists that include:</h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Vendors</li> \t<li id=\"\">Previous clients</li> \t<li id=\"\">Industry experts</li> \t<li id=\"\">Passions and special interests</li></ul><p>The idea is to make your stream of Twitter content manageable. Instead of trying to remember everyone you follow, lists allow you to organize and categorize the people you follow.This will let you quickly and easily connect with the followers you most engage with or actively engage with you. Rather than bouncing all over Twitter, trying to keep up with your favorite content or tweeters, use your lists to stay on top of your stream without it feeling overwhelming.So the next time you log in, instead of fumbling around for someone to retweet or frantically searching for a conversation to join, just hop into one of your lists and see what's happening right now.</p><h3 id=\"\">To create a list:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Go to your Lists page</li> \t<li id=\"\">Click Create list</li> \t<li id=\"\">Enter the name of your list, a short description, and whether or not it will be public (anyone can subscribe to the list) or private (only accessible to you)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Click Save list</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222f5973972092926f4a_twitter-lists.png\" alt=\"twitter lists\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Follow people with similar interests</h2><p>Find people to follow and connect within Twitter directories such as <a href=\"http://www.twellow.com/splash/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Twellow</a> and <a href=\"http://wefollow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">WeFollow</a>. Both sites can introduce you to Twitter users that have similar interests.Not feeling comfortable with Twitter yet? That's ok! Follow other users and observe their tweets.  Get a feel for what and how often they tweet.You will also want to pay attention to <strong id=\"\">how they interact with their followers</strong>. What's working for them and what feels right for you? Now take that knowledge and dive in. Begin to create your own voice, rhythm and content flow.You may also try following the people they are following, but make sure you read their descriptions and visit their blogs to ensure a right fit.Staying focused on your niche or location will make it easy for you to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-active-social-media-community/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">build a community centered on similar interests</a>.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222f5973975a00926f4b_follow-people-on-twitter.png\" alt=\"follow people on twitter\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Get into the conversation</h2><p>Now that you know where to find people, how to follow them and <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/twitter-formula-to-unleash-a-dynamic-personal-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">how to best position your Twitter bio</a>, it's time to get active.Your first step it to look at what the people you are following are up to. What are they sharing?  Take a moment and reply if it interests you.For example, one of your followers is discussing an industry event they'll be attending. They are talking about the speakers, location and friends they will meet face to face.If you share in their enthusiasm, tell them! Creating a common connection will encourage future conversation.Another great way to start a conversation is to reply with your thoughts or feedback.[clickToTweet tweet=\" Want to build better relationships?

It's a NEW Instagram feature that just started rolling a few days ago. When someone mentions you in their Story, you get a notification. Right above their Story in your notifications, it'll say \"Share to your Story\". Tap on that and you can immediately share their post to your Story! You can also add text, stickers, filters, etc. before you post it to your Story. Why is this relevant? Besides being fun, at least 😉 As a brand, this is a great way to encourage your audience to post about your product or service and you can reward them with a shout out in your Stories. If you have a physical location or host events where people post about you, you now have lots of ways to display your business! User generated content (UGC) for the win!

If not, now is the time to get started!\"]While the Twitter preview size is 520 x 254 (a 2:1 ratio), I’ve found that an image size of 1024 x 512 pixels works perfectly within the feed.<strong id=\"\">To determine what text will show up within your image, you could use this formula</strong> from <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/twitter-in-stream-images/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Laura Rhoeder</a>:<em id=\"\">\"Divide the width of your image in half to find the 2:1 ratio and the number of vertical pixels you have to work with. Now divide the in-stream preview height in half. Using the same example as above, you would divide 1024 in half to get 512.From the horizontal line in the center of your image (the Y axis), move up that number of pixels (e.g., 512) on the Y-axis and draw another horizontal line. Do the same thing again, but moving down the Y-axis from the center of the image.Everything inside that blue box is the in-stream preview. The blue box aligns with Twitter’s 2:1 template and is centered vertically to keep the best part of your picture visible.\"</em>Or, <strong id=\"\">you can make it easy on yourself and create your images in a tool like </strong><a href=\"http://canva.com\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Canva</strong></a><strong id=\"\"> or </strong><a href=\"http://www.quotescover.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">QuotesCover</strong></a> that will help you determine where to place your text.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222ef5406607625d675a_twitter-image-size.png\" alt=\"twitter image size\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Facebook</h2><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Page Cover Photo Dimensions: 820 x 312</li> \t<li id=\"\">Group Cover Photo: 820 x 428</li> \t<li id=\"\">Profile Cover Photo: 851 x 310</li> \t<li id=\"\">Event Cover Photo: 500 x 262</li> \t<li id=\"\">Shared Images: 1200 x 630</li></ul><p>If you're ready to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-facebook-to-market-your-business/\" id=\"\">turn up the volume on your business</a> and gain the edge over your competition, it's time to get visual on Facebook.<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/12-most-powerful-ways-to-create-facebook-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Meaningful Facebook conversations</a> begin with great content, this includes the images you share.Use your Facebook cover photo and newsfeed images to connect fans to your brand.

But too often, businesses skip the specifics and instead choose to use a call to action (CTA) that only speaks in generalities.This is a lost opportunity to take a casual fan or follower and convert them into a subscriber or potential client.So, what exactly is a call to action?According to Wikipedia,</p><blockquote id=\"\">A call to action, or CTA, is a banner, button, or some type of graphic or text on a website meant to prompt a user to click it and continue down a conversion funnel.</blockquote><p>In other words, it’s the driving force behind the interaction, engagement, clicks and shares on your posts.The right call to action can inspire an immediate response and turn lookie-loo’s into leads and eventual sales.If you're posts are failing to convert and your calls to action are non-existent, the <strong id=\"\">five tips below are designed to help you increase clicks</strong> and engagement.</p><h1 id=\"\">5 Social Media Conversion Ideas</h1><h2 id=\"\">1.

Don’t leave it to chance.Whether it’s a click-through, download or share, don’t be shy in telling your audience exactly what you want them to do.You never want to assume that your social media fans and followers know what action you want them to take.<a href=\"http://instagram.com/kohls\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Kohl’s</a> is a prime example of a brand crystal clear on each call to action they share.Not only do they pull you in through their use of gorgeous images, but they also leave you eager to rush into the store or better yet, do a little shopping from the luxury of your computer.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222ea53a590fa0b36bb3_kohls.png\" alt=\"kohls\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">3. Understand Your Market</h2><blockquote id=\"\">The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself. – Peter Drucker</blockquote><p>Social media offers businesses an incredible opportunity to connect, engage and heighten awareness around a product or service.However, simply stating what you do isn’t enough.

Speak Your Audience’s Language</h2><p>Do you know what your audience is searching for when researching your business, niche, product, or service? Understanding the words, phrases and terms used will help you <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">speak directly to your audience’s needs</a>.Stay away from industry-speak and jargon that tends to confuse consumers.

Each one is designed to substantially boost engagement and take your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/find-your-social-media-groove/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media interaction</a>, traffic and shares from so-so to super!</p><h1 id=\"\">Social Media Marketing Tactics for Today's Top Networks</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Facebook Questions</h2><p>Have you seen a decline in your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/use-facebook-to-market-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook engagement</a>? If so, you’re not alone. In fact, there's been such an enormous uproar over the loss of organic Facebook reach that Jay Baer dubbed it the \"<a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-tools/this-chart-explains-the-reachpocalypse-and-why-facebook-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">reachpocalypse</a>.\"We know that in order for your Facebook fans to see your posts, you must get them engaged with your page. The challenge is that this has become increasingly difficult to make happen.So, how can you generate enough interaction to consistently show up in the newsfeed of your audience?<strong id=\"\"> Through the power of questions!</strong>KISSmetrics revealed that <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/more-likes-on-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">posts including questions</a> receive 100 percent more comments than text-based posts. While this might not be a surprise to many seasoned marketers, you could be missing a powerful opportunity.In a study by Buddy Media it was shown that the <a href=\"http://www.salesforcemarketingcloud.com/resources/ebooks/strategies-for-effective-wall-posts-a-timeline-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">placement of the question</a> makes all the difference. By placing the question at the end of a post, you increase your interaction rate by 15 percent. You also double the rate of comments when compared to posts where the question is added at the beginning or in the middle.While both of these surveys are a couple years old, the data is just as relevant today as it was then. I see daily that the right questions are a key component to getting fans involved in the conversation.Don't believe me? Try it out on your own Facebook post. Place attention-grabbing questions at the end of your posts. Then track the difference it makes within your engagement.A great example of this in action is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jeep\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Jeep</a>.

Twitter Characters</h2><p>Have you ever crafted the perfect tweet only to find that no one else felt the same way? Your tweet seemed to fall on deaf ears, receiving zero interaction and no retweets.If this has happened to you, chances are you used up every last character and left no room for sharing.Your first instinct might be to use all 140 characters, but you'd be wrong. Buffer and SumAll recently found that the <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/optimal-length-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">optimal tweet</a> is between 71-100 characters.  And those tweets under 100 characters received a <strong id=\"\">17 percent higher engagement</strong>.I tested this theory and found that one tweet at exactly 100 characters received 57% more retweets than alternative verbiage at 101 and above.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Top Trends to Dominate Your 2015 Social Media Marketing Strategy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/business?src=hash\" id=\"\">#business</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/9IKcsUJKs9\" id=\"\">http://t.co/9IKcsUJKs9</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/oDG5SaOInM\" id=\"\">pic.twitter.com/oDG5SaOInM</a>— Rebekah Radice (@RebekahRadice) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RebekahRadice/status/551767252920696832\" id=\"\">January 4, 2015</a></blockquote><p>Keep this in mind as you craft your tweets, and don't forget to factor in your Twitter handle.

Google Plus Flexibility</h2><p>Google Plus has an audience too large to ignore and yet many businesses still fail to take advantage of this social media powerhouse.While Twitter embraces brevity, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/boost-google-plus-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Google Plus is the most flexible social network</a> when it comes to content length. Using the full expanse of Google Plus post real estate not only helps in your engagement, but also in establishing credibility.It’s also the only social network on this list that allows you to format your posts. This is another way to position your content as readable and easily shareable. Let me show you an example from Google Plus power user <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a>.The post below has used several elements of formatting. The headline is bold, the sub headline is italicized, and there's a tip from the post included. It all makes it an enjoyable read and easy to consume.Don't know how to get started?

Visualize Your Goals</h2><p>Visualization is your first step and a vital component to your success. I will warn you that this isn't an easy place to start. However, dismissing this as trite or insignificant will set you up for failure.</p><h4 id=\"\">There are three ways to get started with this process:</h4><p><strong id=\"\">1. Use a tool or app.</strong> If you want to establish new habits, put a reminder system in place. <a href=\"http://lifetick.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Lifetick</a> helps you visualize, strategize and then track the status of your goals.You begin by defining your values. From there, you set your goals. This is one of my favorite features of Lifetick as it works off the idea that your goals should be <a href=\"http://sbinformation.about.com/od/businessmanagemen1/a/businessgoals.htm\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">SMART</a>:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Specific </strong><em id=\"\">Have you been specific in what you want to achieve? </em></li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Measurable </strong><em id=\"\">How will you know if you've achieved your goal? </em></li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Achievable </strong><em id=\"\">Is this a goal that you can achieve?</em></li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Relevant </strong><em id=\"\">Is this goal aligned with your mission, vision and values? </em></li> \t<li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Time Specific </strong><em id=\"\">When do you want to achieve this goal by?</em></li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222d0480ca8502c3dfb0_lifetick.jpeg\" alt=\"lifetick\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p><strong id=\"\">2. Discuss your goals with a coach or mentor. </strong> Share your goals with someone who can hold you accountable, but make sure you're open, honest and specific.This is the only way to take your intangible goals and turn them into a solid plan. I've had a business coach for much of my adult career and can tell you that my failed <a href=\"http://d11consulting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">coaching relationships</a> were because I held back. If you want one that's beneficial to the health of your business, you have to be transparent.<strong id=\"\">3. Use a vision board. </strong>I've used vision boards for years with my team. Not only are they a great team building exercise, but also get everyone on the same page.But if it's just you, don't worry. This exercise still works.<strong id=\"\">Here's how to create your vision board:</strong></p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Get comfy! The first important rule of vision board creation is mindset. You can't have the right mindset if you're uncomfortable or agitated with your surroundings.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Take the goals you defined above and think how this board will represent inspiration for months to come.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Grab a stack of magazines and start clipping anything that visually captures one of your goals. For example, you know that in order to grow your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-presence/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a> presence, you'll need to speak at multiple events. Find images of people speaking, standing in front of a group, of a larger audience -- you get the idea.</li></ul><p>Need inspiration? Look no further than Pinterest!

Write It Down</h2><p>With all the technology available today, sometimes my favorite tools are the simplest ones. Take a pen and paper and write down what you want to achieve.How will social media support your marketing goals? What does success look like and how will you know when you've arrived?Be as clear as possible when writing out your goals.</p><h4 id=\"\">For example:</h4><p>Your goal is to create an enthusiastic base of company advocates. To do this, you must consistently share relevant content that your fans and followers want to read and share with their community.<strong id=\"\">You need to:</strong></p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Track and measure content shares</li> \t<li id=\"\">Quickly respond to comments and questions</li> \t<li id=\"\">Gauge the temperature of your community</li> \t<li id=\"\">Analyze what’s working and what’s not</li></ul><p>When you think through your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media goals</a> in a linear fashion, you begin to see the full picture emerge.And for me, something magical happens when I see all of this written out. The act of putting pen to paper allows me to mentally commit to those goals.But I understand that this process isn’t for everyone. If you’d rather not go old school, you can use a tool like <a href=\"http://evernote.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Evernote</a>.Here’s a goal setting template from <a href=\"http://www.cloudproductivity.net/evernote-template-for-setting-realistic-goals/\" id=\"\">Cloud Productivity</a> to get you started!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222d0480cae82ac3dfb1_evernote-goal-template.jpeg\" alt=\"evernote goal template\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">3.

It's letting people have access to information without having to contact you or have a meeting with you or telephone call with you or Hangout with you. That kind of self-serve information can be really challenging because you're like,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"Hey, I spent all this time, either in school or in business to learn these things, and now you're saying give that all away?\"</blockquote><p>But here's the thing and how Youtility works - you give away knowledge snacks to sell information meals. So, you're giving away little bits of what you know, a taste at a time as an hors d'oeuvre and you use those hors d'oeuvres to get people to,A. Trust youB. Believe in youAnd after that happens,  then they want to actually have a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/effective-relationship-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">relationship</a> with you but that takes some time and it takes some measure of courage to actually give away what you know, even a little bit at a time.<strong id=\"\">Rebekah: One of the biggest misconceptions I see, no matter what umbrella you’re under, is that a real estate professional is still a personal brand. I loved your examples of my friends Raj Qsar and Anne Jones and how they're standing out online.Jay:</strong> Raj is from <a href=\"http://www.theboutiquere.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">The Boutique Real Estate Group</a> and their use of high-end real estate video is incredible. It doesn't just say, \"Hey, here, look, they have a fence. Look! A pool.\" It actually tells a story.It's almost like a mini documentary film that not only gives you what might be classified as a video brochure, but this tells an emotional story.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zY_TBaR-qq0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><p>In some cases, there are actually actors in their real estate movies. It ties back to sort of an emotional level and this will probably be a corny way to say this is, but they create videos that make a house feel like a home.Anne Jones, a <a href=\"http://tacomajones.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">real estate professional in Tacoma</a>, is in a completely different market and uses video in a very different way. Anne gives you a behind the scenes look into her business and shares how cost effective using video to showcase a home can truly can be.Anne hires a professional to do those video tours, but she also uses Google Hangouts to just sit down and talk about what she does. She has a willingness to give information away -- \"Here's exactly how I do this and here's the budget and I'm not holding anything back.\"I think that is particularly admirable because the real estate industry has historically tended to say, \"This is my secret. I'm not going to share my secret with you.\"</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/JZaNEPJ9kaE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">My Takeaways</h2><p>I was incredibly honored to sit down with Jay and loved discussing how so many real estate professionals are crushing it within their local market. However, my key takeaway was this.No matter your industry, you always have a chance to shape and mold perception. You have the opportunity to change how information is shared and how potential clients find and interact with you. Just because your competition pushes out content or promotes the hard sell -- all off the time -- doesn't mean you have to.Ask yourself every day, how can I help, not sell to my potential customer and how can I be a benefit that will make them naturally want to connect, engage and interact?As Jay says, \"the difference between helping and selling is just two letters. But those letters make all the difference. Your company needs to become a YOUtility. Sell something, and you make a customer. Help someone, and you make a customer for life.\"</p><h3 id=\"\">Watch the Full Interview Here</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ryzOYjv0pwA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure>",

It takes a commitment to sharing relevant content in a way that inspires your fans and followers to interact and take action.It also requires consistent conversation. Conversation that allows you to easily stay connected and top of mind. So how can you <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/how-to-have-remarkable-social-media-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">create vibrant conversations</a> that fuel visibility and increase awareness around your small business?Below are easy and effective<strong id=\"\"> small business tactics for better social media connections!</strong></p><h1 id=\"\">Create Better Social Media Connections</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Create Social Networks Worth Visiting</h2><p>Are your social channels appealing?Have you created a space that’s inviting to both visitors and current followers?</p><h5 id=\"\">Spruce it up by answering a few quick questions!</h5><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What’s the first impression anyone landing on your site will receive? You only get one chance, so take this one seriously!</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are you sharing relevant content in a way that resonates with your potential clients?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do you discuss local matters in a way that makes sense to your community?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is your page or profile interactive?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do you have a Call to Action?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Have past clients given testimonials?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are you sharing multiple forms of content including video, images and text?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is your content easy to read and well-written?</li></ol><p>Social media is fluid. In order to maintain fan and follower attention, you need to constantly adjust to meet their needs.Add the above questions to your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">calendar</a> and run a review quarterly to stay ahead of the curve.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Be an Active Listener</h2><p>Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are excellent catalysts for conversation. Nevertheless, a conversation doesn’t truly become beneficial until both parties are involved.Become an active listener in order to quickly respond and meet the needs of your fans and followers in real-time. Tools such as <a href=\"http://socialmention.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Mention</a> allow you to monitor the conversations happening in and around your business.Use it to search your company name, local phrases like your city or community, and keyword search terms. Once you begin to dive into that information, you can use it to create content. <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/26-tips-for-writing-great-blog-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Write a blog post</a> around a specific question or create a video tip responding to a need.You can also use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search-advanced\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Twitter Advanced Search</a> to monitor your name or keyword phrases. Monitoring certain phrases will allow you to respond while the thought is fresh in the mind of the consumer.Lets say you're a real estate professional, an example might be a search for your local area. Anyone looking to“buy a home in Denver” could be a potential client. Searching that term will bring up anyone who uses that phrase within their tweet.If you don't have the time, put someone in charge of monitoring these tweets so you can respond with engaging -- not hard sell and spammy tweets.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Be a Resource</h2><p>Gaining a social media following will require that you share relevant content along with your thoughts, ideas and insight around the topic or your industry/niche.As a small business owner, understanding the needs of your consumer is critical. Below are a few tips to help you become the go-to resource.</p><h5 id=\"\">Content Ideas to Share</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Unique photos of your business with fun and engaging questions. Example: “Who wouldn’t want a tasty ice cream sundae on a hot day?” We know we would!”</li> \t<li id=\"\">Always add a call to action – what’s the next step you would like anyone connecting with you on social media to take? Make it simple for them to ask a question or click through to your website to learn more about your company.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Talk about an upcoming local or sponsored event, why you’re involved and why it matters to your social media fans and followers.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Tell the stories of past and current clients. How did your company solve a problem or help when no one else could? People love feel-good stories and stories humanize a business.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Answer questions around your business or product and share how you make their life easier. The key is to make the buying process feel safe and comfortable.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  4. Get Visual</h2><p>The results are in. We live in a highly visual world.<a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/insights/visual-content-marketing-infographic/\" id=\"\">Studies</a> have repeatedly shown that <strong id=\"\">people respond positively to photos and videos</strong> far more than they do articles.Use this to your advantage.</p><h5 id=\"\">Two Visual Content Post Ideas:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Quotes from your latest blog post – use a tool like <a href=\"http://savepublishing.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Save Publishing</a> to pull quotes from your blog posts. Then add them to a high-impact graphic.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Unique product/service features – what makes your product or service special and what makes you stand out? Identify what differentiates you and then share that in a way that captures the attention of your target audience.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"> 5. Stay In The Conversation</h2><p>Is your company guilty of posting and then running off, never to return? If you’re using social media as a one-way bullhorn, you’re missing the point.Social media is interactive. It’s a vibrant, lively space. But only when you take the time to stay in the conversation.While sharing valuable content is important, it won’t automatically create conversation. Take the time to ask questions, listen to your fans and followers and respond in a timely manner.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">You’re building relationships and relationships take time. Get involved in the conversation or you'll find you're talking, but no one is listening. &gt;&gt; </em><a href=\"http://ctt.ec/QcURd\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">TWEET THIS</em></a></h4><p>Just as in the offline world, it’s considered <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-etiquette-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">poor etiquette</a> within social media if you “run into the room” screaming about your company, and never take the time to get to know anyone.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Track Your Success</h2><p>And finally, <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/3-strategies-to-measure-your-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">track, measure and adjust your strategy</a>.Winston Churchill said it best,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.” Lets face it, at the end of the day if we achieve results then there is always a cause for celebration.”</blockquote><p>As a small business owner, your responsibility is to generate sales and increase revenue.

Guy and Peg are the authors of the book, \"<a href=\"http://artof.social/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">The Art of Social Media: Power Tips for Power Users</a>\" and two of my favorite social media power users.I was fortunate to be the first person to get a sneak peek at their new book a few months ago and thrilled to take part in the kickoff celebration.</p><h3 id=\"\">In this interview, you'll learn:</h3><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Why you need to build a powerful social media foundation</li>\t<li id=\"\">How to gain marketshare, no matter the size of your business</li>\t<li id=\"\">Steps to quickly (and effectively) optimize your social media profiles</li>\t<li id=\"\">How to build a following and attract a loyal following</li>\t<li id=\"\">Why you must create an integrated social media and blogging strategy</li></ul><p>If you've struggled to grow your online presence, then you won't want to miss this conversation! Guy and Peg are real, unplugged and totally candid in how they've <strong id=\"\">amassed over 10 million followers combined</strong>. That's quite the feat!Read an excerpt below and then watch the replay to learn how you can <strong id=\"\">master the art of social media</strong>!</p><h1 id=\"\">Become a Social Media Superstar</h1><h4 id=\"\">Rebekah: What is your best piece of advice for a small business owner struggling to find the time for social media?</h4><p><strong id=\"\">Guy:</strong> The first thing I would like to tell this small business owner is, I don't think you should look at social media as something else you're doing because, I assume that every small business has to do marketing rather than saying you're going to do marketing plus social media, just combine the two that social media is marketing. Would you say if you're a small business, you're too busy to do marketing? Never.I like to use this example: the street food vendor in LA who has 75,000 followers on Twitter and he tweets out that his street food truck is going to be at this corner of two streets and he appears there and there are 100 people waiting to buy tacos. That's a small business using social media. It doesn't take hours and hours and days and days and digital agencies helping you. It’s that simple.<strong id=\"\">Rebekah:</strong> What I hear you saying is truly a mindset shift, it's really how you look at social media.<strong id=\"\">Guy:</strong> I would say that social media is democratizing marketing because marketing used to be reserved for people who have creative expertise and had the money to buy space, time whatever. This street food vendor in Los Angeles he's not going to advertise in the LA Times, he's not going to advertise on the LA TV stations, LA radio stations.To a large degree, if it was prior to social media, he had a truck and the best case is he blows his horn when he gets to a place and hopes people come out of a building, so he had no marketing. Social media has empowered him to do marketing that he could have never done before because social media is fast, free and ubiquitous. It's the holy grail of marketing.</p><h4 id=\"\">Rebekah: How can a business eager to expand their presence through social media gain market share?</h4><p><strong id=\"\">Guy:</strong> My theory for most people is that you should establish a reputation and position yourself as an expert in your field, Let's take a hypothetical case of a real estate broker. Ultimately, real estate brokers want listings and they want to sell houses. The question is: how are you perceived?</p><blockquote id=\"\">To become valuable, you need to create and re-create content that your target market needs.</blockquote><p>I would offer high-value articles and establish a reputation for being an expert, so that when the time comes, you will be top of mind.<strong id=\"\">Rebekah:</strong> Just to go a little bit deeper, what if this person were to say to you -- that's great in theory. However, they’re currently creating valuable content, but nobody is finding or interacting with them. This can be especially true on a local level. So, what’s the answer? How do you “get found?”<strong id=\"\">Guy:</strong> I think the first thing I would do is search for other people in the business in the geographic area and start commenting on their posts and interacting with their posts to get into the flow of things.<strong id=\"\">Peg:</strong> I would definitely say hashtags. You could come up with a hashtag strategy that is going to connect you with people that want to connect locally. You want to geo-tag things, you want to use hashtags for your local area, so people can find you.</p><h4 id=\"\">Rebekah: We talk a lot about businesses trying to be everything to everybody or everywhere at all times. Do businesses need to have a presence everywhere and on every social network?</h4><p><strong id=\"\">Peg:</strong> Pick your favorite two and if you haven't done any at all pick one and really excel at that before you go on to anything else. Once you master one, add another one.Pick a social network that is relevant to what your product or service is and then find another one that works with it. It really has to do with your type of business and where your market is spending their time.</p><blockquote id=\"\">There is no one-size-fits-all for any social media, so it's really what you can fit in your schedule and what works best with what your goals are.</blockquote><h4 id=\"\">Rebekah: You’re both big proponents of getting as much mileage as you can out of one piece of content. How should businesses maximize how they’re sharing content?</h4><p><strong id=\"\">Guy:</strong> People have a misconception about sharing content. For example, if you write a post, the misconception is that you only post it to your social networks once. The hardest thing is writing the post, once you have written the post, send it out multiple times and to multiple places.<strong id=\"\">Peg: </strong>Find ways to cross introduce your content across various social networks. This will allow people to follow you where they are most comfortable while opening you up to a whoe new audience.LinkedIn and Slideshare are a perfect example of great integration where everything you do on Slideshare can integrate on LinkedIn. They are making it very easy for you to share your content across both platforms, so why not take advantage of that?</p><h3 id=\"\">Watch the Full Replay</h3><p>No matter if you’re promoting a business, a product, or yourself, knowing how to successfully <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/improve-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">leverage social media</a> is key to your success.If you've struggled to truly harness the power of social media, this interview will give you a roadmap to an integrated strategy that gets you noticed.And don't forget to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Social-Media-Power/dp/1591848075\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">grab a copy of the book</a>!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7N8Ns2qEiq8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure>",

Make Your Headline Click Worthy</h4><p>Similar to blog titles, your <strong id=\"\">Google Plus post headline</strong> is your title. It's the appetizer that will whet your community’s appetite.Rather than using a plain (insert boring) title like “<em id=\"\">Sleeping In,</em>” put a little effort into it and create a compelling title like,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“Why Sleeping In is Costing Your Business Money.”</blockquote><p>See the difference?Peg Fitzpatrick, a <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media strategist</a> is an excellent example of this tactic at work. Her headlines are bold, concise and easy to read.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a80cb8120a5_google-plus-bold-headline.png\" alt=\"google plus bold headline\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h4 id=\"\">B. Make Your Headline Stand Out</h4><p>Now take the next step and <strong id=\"\">make your headline stand out</strong>. This is where Google Plus really allows you to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/smart-google-plus-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">differentiate your posts</a> from any other social network.Use asterisks ** to bold your title or italics to emphasize a word. A <strong id=\"\">bold title</strong> adds a little honey to your tantalizing title.Not familiar with how to format your Google Plus posts? Grab this <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/159526011776701166/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">cheat sheet</a> from Simon Heyes.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51ad3d98120b3_google-plus-format-tips.jpeg\" alt=\"google plus format tips\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">STEP 2: Persuasive Sub Headline</h3><p>Your next step is the sub-headline. This is your attention-grabbing first line. The line that says, “look at me!”Or as <a href=\"http://www.kevinhogan.com/sales-copywriting-two4.htm\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Kevin Hogan</a> puts it,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"The sub headline is like an extension of the headline. It continues to draw the reader in while providing even more intriguing information that keeps them reading.\"</blockquote><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a55ba8120a4_google-plus-headline-e1415574625561.jpeg\" alt=\"google plus headline\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h5 id=\"\">*Bonus* Above the Fold Copy</h5><p>With Google Plus, you have a bonus with four lines \"above the fold\" on it, so use them wisely.Martin Shervington, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.martinshervington.com/google-plus-posts-the-ultimate-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Plus Your Business</a> and a<em id=\"\"> Google+ marketing expert, </em>consistently uses these top four lines to <strong id=\"\">grab followers' attention</strong> as content quickly moves through their feed.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a4be48120a6_google-pus-style-guide.jpeg\" alt=\"google pus style guide\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">STEP 3: Compelling Content</h3><p>While this should go without saying, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/dominate-your-personal-brand-using-google-plus/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">creating the perfect Google Plus post</a> starts with sharing great content.Whether it's your content or someone else's, pass along what about that article grabbed your attention. Take that information and turn that into a thought, question or tid-bit that becomes food for thought or an opportunity to educate.Whatever the case, you want to <strong id=\"\">share context around the content</strong> to add depth and insight to the article.In the example below, take a look at how <a href=\"http://www.thesocialmediahat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Mike Allton</a>, a social media business consultant, asks a question and then shares his own thoughts. Can you see how this tactic would immediately draw people into the conversation?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a9d278120a8_google-plus-content-ideas.png\" alt=\"google plus content ideas\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">STEP 4: Specific Call to Action</h3><p>You're ready to go live now that you've written a great Google Plus post. But don’t hit that “share” button quite yet! Make sure you’ve added your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">persuasive call to action</a>.Your call to action is the exact next step you’re asking your followers to take. Whether it’s a click to read more, download your latest eBook, or to comment below, be clear in your instructions.You never want to assume they know what those next steps are you want them to take.<a href=\"http://robertryan.ie\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Robert Ryan</a>, a WordPress developer, and social media manager offers fans of his Blogging Warfare show the opportunity to review the time-stamped replay. His call to action is simple and clear: \"click here.\"</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51ac8ca8120b5_google-plus-call-to-action.png\" alt=\"google plus call to action\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">STEP 5: Eye-Catching Image</h3><p>Pinterest has made an art out of <strong id=\"\">transforming images into gorgeous eye candy</strong>. Google Plus offers a similar visual appeal.Its layout accommodates larger images that can quickly and easily capture attention if positioned properly.Take <a href=\"http://twelveskip.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pauline Cabrera</a> with TwelveSkip, for example. There's no mistaking her graphics. From the font to the color scheme and layout, each of her images directly represents her brand, making her easily identifiable.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a72878120b6_google-plus-image1.png\" alt=\"google plus image1\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Another way to use images is to grab text from your latest blog post. <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Buffer</a> does this consistently with great success.In this post, they’ve offered thoughts starters for headlines. This gives their Google Plus followers more to chew on than just your standard image. It gets them thinking and becomes a conversation starter.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a19818120b7_google-plus-image2.png\" alt=\"google plus image2\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Next Steps: 3 Google Plus Success Tips</h2><h3 id=\"\">1.  Get Branded</h3><p>Marie Forleo said it best,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“You can smell great branding from a mile away!”</blockquote><p>I couldn’t agree more.From your design to your messaging, your Google Plus graphics must perfectly align with your current brand.Use a tool like <a href=\"http://canva.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Canva </a>or <a href=\"http://picmonkey.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">PicMonkey</a> to create templates that allow you to quickly and easily create images that scream you and your business.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a0bb88120b8_get-branded.png\" alt=\"get branded\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">2.  Give Your Readers a Reason to Respond</h3><p>Want to create better engagement?

He shares a little bit about himself, his business and why he’s using Google Plus.Instead of it feeling spammy, his post feels conversational and invites others to share their story as well.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51af8a88120b4_say-hello-on-google-plus.png\" alt=\"say hello on google plus\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">3.

Jeff highlights an article each day and then encourages his followers to hop over to his <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/jeffsieh/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pinterest profile</a> and pin that article for later.It’s brilliant in that it has two purposes – to repurpose content, give it a second life, and to cross-promote another social network.How could you use this tactic to better promote your own content?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bf9d51a956f8120a7_cross-promote-on-google-plus.png\" alt=\"cross promote on google plus\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>Google Plus is a veritable wonderland of opportunity for business professionals.

Share Your Story</h2><p>Stories bind and connect. They create points of interest and encourage deeper, more significant relationships.As Ian Rowden, Chief Marketing Officer, Virgin Group says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“The best brands are built on great stories.“</blockquote><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">What is your company story? </em></h4><p>Your story is so much more than social media posts or the copy on your blog. It's the emotions you evoke and the beliefs your customers hold about your company.A great story is the reason we choose one brand over another. Think about it. When was the last time you bought a car?While many factors played into your purchase decision, much of your \"why\" came from feelings towards that brand. From Volkswagen to Mercedes, your relationship with a company steers your decision.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">How can you share your company story?</em></h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What details can you share that will allow customers to make an educated decision about your business?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What insight can you offer around the early days of your company?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How can you clearly communicate the essence of your company?</li></ul><p>People love to learn more about you while gaining a better understanding into your motivation.

Don’t Be a Carbon Copy</h2><p>In an online world where copycats exist more than ever before, it’s essential that you create your own unique persona.Brands such as <a href=\"http://apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"http://starbucks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Starbucks</a> have done an excellent job creating brands that are set apart from anything else online. And the amazing part about that is the fact that Apple has shunned social media.Starbucks on the other hand has taken their established offline brand and translated it into a vibrant online coffee culture.Could someone emulate their established brand? Of course, and they have. Can there be an exact duplicate? Not in my opinion.Find your own voice, rhythm and creative content to share across social media. It will resonate with the right people and allow those that matter to stand up and take notice.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222b6c28f45f07e40cd8_how-to-use-social-media-to-stand-out.png\" alt=\"how-to-use-social-media-to-stand-out\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4.

In fact, Pinterest is now my number one social media traffic referral source.Over the last two years, I’ve watched as my Pinterest traffic has skyrocketed. I attribute this to a couple of reasons:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">I don’t believe in one-off tactics.</li> \t<li id=\"\">I do believe in an integrated strategy.</li></ul><p>What do I mean by this? If you’re a blogger, you can’t just live in one corner of the world. Posting to Facebook does not equal a blog promotional strategy.As a blogger, you must create content and then repurpose and position it in a creative and engaging way. Pinterest can help you do this effortlessly.If you’ve been on the fence about Pinterest, I challenge you to dip your toe in the water.To help you get started, I’ve put together my top ways to use Pinterest to boost blog traffic exponentially.</p><h1 id=\"\">Use Pinterest to Boost Blog Traffic</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Make Your Post Pinnable</h2><p>Would you believe that statistics show articles including images receive <a href=\"http://www.jeffbullas.com/2012/05/28/6-powerful-reasons-why-you-should-include-images-in-your-marketing-infographic/#WQGVooS480DL8Gwj.99\" id=\"\">94 percent more total views</a>? And yet, I visit blogs daily that still don’t include an image.Go back through your articles and create a captivating Pinterest image that represents your business and content. Begin to add those images to your articles and then pin them to Pinterest.Not only will this create additional content for your Pinterest boards, but will also refresh an old post, driving new traffic and potential customers to your blog.So, what does a shareable image look like? A <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-pinterest-images-that-get-shared/\" id=\"\">Pinterest image that gets shared</a> is captivating, straightforward, and high-value. The one below went viral and now is the <strong id=\"\">first result of a Pinterest search for the term “social media.”</strong> (Note: the one beside it links to my blog as well: <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-etiquette-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media etiquette</a>)Not bad for a couple of images that were created once and then shared thousands of times, right?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bbde7a7b1d783d00d_pinterest-social-media-search.png\" alt=\"pinterest social media search\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Cross Pollinate</h2><p>As I discussed above, you never want to be a one-trick pony when it comes to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/profitable-blog-strategy/\" id=\"\">blog promotion</a>. Pin your blog articles to Pinterest and then share your image to other social networks like Google+, Twitter and Instagram.Allow your fans and followers to connect with you where they feel most comfortable, then use a <a href=\"http://blog.canva.com/5-ways-create-social-media-call-action-converts/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Call to Action</a> to direct them to Pinterest and ultimately back over to your blog.This will help you <strong id=\"\">gain additional blog subscribers</strong> while increasing audience growth on multiple social platforms.<a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a> uses the \"Pin of the Day\" call to action when she shares her content. Whether it's on Google+ or Facebook, you'll find that her commitment to cross-pollination is what keeps her fans and followers active and supportive, no matter the social channel.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=662650560514889&id=415415051905109\" id=\"\">Post</a> by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/PegFitzpatrick/415415051905109\" id=\"\">PegFitzpatrick</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Get Branded</h2><p>Custom images create a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/build-a-sensational-personal-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">memorable brand experience</a>. They connect the dots between business and consumer, making your content easily identifiable.Not only that, but they provide a stimulant for better buying decisions. In a study by <a href=\"http://www.customcontentcouncil.com/news/roper-finds-majority-consumers-value-custom-media\" id=\"\">Custom Content Council,</a> two thirds of consumers polled said they were more likely to buy from a company using custom media.There’s also a psychological component to branded images. Psychologist Jerome Bruner has found that while <a href=\"http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/925-image-stats.html#ixzz3HxUByNpc\" id=\"\">people only remember 10 percent of things they hear</a> and 20 percent of what they have read, they’ll remember 80 percent of what they see or do.If you want to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/stand-out-online/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">stand out online</a>, you need to get branded!Create your own images with tools such as <a href=\"http://picmonkey.com\" id=\"\">PicMonkey</a> and <a href=\"http://canva.com\" id=\"\">Canva</a> or follow Donna Moritz with <a href=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/creating-images-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Socially Sorted</a>.

Use Search to Capture Consumer Attention</h2><p>Images are a powerful way to capture consumer attention.In a study by <a href=\"http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/925-image-stats.html#ixzz3HxUaF6rE\" id=\"\">Bright Local</a>, it was found that 60 percent of <strong id=\"\">consumers favor search results that include images</strong>.  Another 23 percent are more likely to contact a business including an image.Whether you're looking to showcase your company, product or service, images pack the one-two punch your blog post needs to gain additional attention. Adding your images to Pinterest only improves the chances of you getting found in search.But search isn't just about Google anymore. Earlier this year, Pinterest launched \"<a href=\"http://blog.pinterest.com/post/83772264616/guided-search-a-new-way-to-find-what-youre-looking\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Guided Search</a>,\" giving people the ability to quickly sift through their over 750 million boards and 30 billion Pins.As <strong id=\"\">Pinterest explains</strong>,</p><blockquote id=\"\">Now when you search for something (road trips, running, summer BBQ), descriptive guides will help you sift through all the good ideas from other Pinners. Scroll through the guides and tap any that look interesting to steer your search in the right direction.</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/8-pinterest-tips-tricks-cheat-sheet-newbies/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Optimize your pins for search</a> by including industry or niche specific keywords.Think about your target market and determine what they're typing in search when looking for your product or service. Now use those in your Pin descriptions.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_YSFv4jWxY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Make Images the Optimal Size</h2><p>Infographics are extremely popular on Pinterest, but not necessarily the optimal size for your blog graphics.If you do it right, you can <strong id=\"\">create an image that works well on multiple platforms</strong>. With the perfect size, design, layout, content and color, your image is ideal for Pinterest,Tumblr and Google+.Keep in mind, all of the platforms above favor vertical images.  It was also found in a study by <a href=\"http://curalate.tumblr.com/post/75811710390/beautify-your-content-8-image-features-that-shine-on\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Curalate</a> that,</p><blockquote id=\"\">Vertical images with an aspect ratio of 2:3 and 4:5 got 60 percent more repins than very tall images. (think Infographics)</blockquote><p>The sweet spot for my images is 735 x 1200. However, that's been an evolving number and one I'm constantly testing. As with anything in social media, what works today may not be what works tomorrow.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bbde7a71bb783d00c_use-pinterest-to-boost-blog-traffic.jpeg\" alt=\"use pinterest to boost blog traffic\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222bbde7a76c6a83cffa_rebekah-radice-pinterest.png\" alt=\"rebekah radice pinterest\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p> Pinterest can be an incredible tool to drive traffic to your blog and boost online exposure.As seen in this graphic, Pinterest is not static. Your pins live a long and healthy life, sending consistent traffic to your blog.Let Pinterest create a conversation around your brand. Allow others to share your content and edify your business.Start to build a community of fans eager to share your content and create a frenzy of interaction.Because as you create and share more content, you position yourself as an expert within your field and a go-to resource.And when you become a resource, you begin to establish trust and rapport. Once you do that, you now have the ability to capture the attention (and earn the business) of your perfect client.<em id=\"\">How can you use Pinterest to boost blog traffic and grow your business exponentially?</em></p>",

In a <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">HubSpot study</a>, it was found that 61% of consumers made purchases based on a blog post and that 70% learned about a company through its blog.Those statistics make it clear that if you're not blogging, your company is missing a huge opportunity. While you sit on the sidelines, your competition is passing you by. It's time to take the plunge, or get left behind.If you're eager to build a successful business blog, acquire new customers and gain meaningful connections, this article will walk you through the process step by step.Ready to get started?Let's go!</p><h1 id=\"\">6 Steps to a Profitable Business Blog</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Get Clear</h2><h3 id=\"\">Find Your Niche</h3><p>Your first step is to define your topic and <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">find your niche</a>.</p><h5 id=\"\">Understand Your Passion</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">What topic or niche are you deeply passionate about?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What would you do you for free?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What would you spend every minute of every day doing if you could?</li></ul><blockquote id=\"\">Follow your passion, be prepared to work hard and sacrifice, and, above all, don't let anyone limit your dreams. - Donovan Bailey</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Stay Laser Focused</h3><p>Readers want to know what they’ll get every time they land on your blog. If you bounce from one topic to the next, you’re going to find it difficult to build a following.Get <strong id=\"\">hyper-specific about who your target market is</strong> and what type of content they’re looking for. Once you do this, you can produce content (and a product) that's specific to their exact needs.</p><h3 id=\"\">Be Original</h3><p>This is your blog. Own it. Don’t constantly repost someone else’s work. If you want to stand out, you need to create original content.Find your why; understand your mission and vision and then work to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/outshine-competition-online/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">express that in your own words</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Uncover Your Unique Voice</h2><h3 id=\"\">Be Genuine</h3><p>We talk a lot about <strong id=\"\">authenticity and transparency</strong> in the online world. Both are equally important and no longer optional, but rather requirements if you want to build credibility and authority.People will quickly sniff out anything that feels inauthentic. Remember that blog you visited only to find out that they didn't practice what they preach? You never returned, right?Don't be that blogger. Be genuine in your actions and interactions.</p><blockquote id=\"\">If you take a sincere interest in others, they’ll take a real interest in you.</blockquote><h3 id=\"\">Try this Exercise</h3><p>Talk out a post as you write it. Instead of worrying about how it sounds as you write, go back and edit later.Over-thinking a post can lead to hard to read and often boring articles. <strong id=\"\">Allow your personality to shine through</strong> instead of inhibiting your true voice.</p><h3 id=\"\">Be Lighthearted</h3><p>Even if you’re writing about something serious, it helps to infuse your writing with something fun or entertaining.Don’t be afraid to keep your writing and tone light. While you might write about serious topics, there’s no reason you can’t inject a little humor every once in a while.</p><h3 id=\"\">Be Yourself</h3><p>While this one should go without saying, I’m going to throw it out there anyway. No one wants to read another carbon copy blog.Sure it can be tempting to imitate your favorite writer, especially when you’re first getting started. However, I guarantee you’ll find far more <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/things-you-wish-you-knew-before-you-started-your-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">blogging success</a> if you can carve out your own unique space within a crowded blogging world.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Select Your Tactics</h2><h3 id=\"\">Simplify</h3><p>As I said, it’s a busy online world. To capture the attention of fast-paced readers, keep your domain name and design simple. The days of flashy, crowded designs are over. Today, clean and fresh designs stand out.Translate the <strong id=\"\">essence of your business</strong> through a sleek, but simplistic design and lightweight theme.</p><h3 id=\"\">Match Your Blog and Domain Name</h3><p>Finding the right domain name is a crucial piece to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/powerful-blog-post/\" id=\"\">building a successful blog</a>.Do your research, understand the keywords people are using to find your product or service and then keep your blog and domain name consistent.</p><h3 id=\"\">Make it Your Own</h3><p>Being similar to someone else is unoriginal and lacks the unique flair needed to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/stand-online/\" id=\"\">stand out online</a>. It can also label you a copycat and create havoc within the search engines.Avoid this by putting your own unique spin on everything you do. From content to visuals, <strong id=\"\">everything across your blog should scream YOU</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"\">Pick a Content Management System</h3><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Sift through your options and choose what's best. This is one of your single biggest decisions. Don't take it lightly.</li>\t<li id=\"\">There are a lot of options, but if you're blogging for business, Wordpress is your best choice in my opinion. It's flexible and user friendly, no matter the business.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Make your decision based on functionality and needs. What will you need from your blog and how do you want it to look?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Hosting is an enormous decision and should be discussed with a professional. There are a lot of options to choose from. Understand what they are and how they will best support your growing business.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  4. Grow Your Presence</h2><h3 id=\"\">Create a Schedule</h3><p>Whether it’s every day, three times a week or every other Monday, find what <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" id=\"\">blogging schedule </a>works best for you. You can’t expect to grow your readership if they never know when you're going to post.</p><h3 id=\"\">Stick to It</h3><p>If you create a consistent posting schedule, readers will know what to expect. Let them know your schedule and keep them coming back for more.And <strong id=\"\">don't forget to use email to notify your readers</strong>. Sending out a quick \"here's my latest post\" email will keep your blog top of mind.</p><h3 id=\"\">Make it Easy</h3><p>Don’t make your readers sign up for something or sign in to engage with you. That’s just annoying.If you put up too many roadblocks and make it difficult to interact on your blog, readers won’t come back and they definitely won’t get involved in the conversation.</p><h3 id=\"\">Respond to Comments and Emails</h3><p>The feedback you get is one of the most valuable parts of <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/writing-best-blog-post/\" id=\"\">blogging</a>. Take the time to respond to comments, making it a part of your blog schedule.You will make the greatest connections and, most likely, meet some really terrific people along the way.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Use Visual Aids</h2><h3 id=\"\">Photos</h3><p>A great smartphone is all you need to get started. A DSLR will take your pictures to a whole new level. Whatever the case, integrate visuals into your blog!</p><h3 id=\"\">Videos</h3><p>Try taking a how-to angle in your area of expertise, as these are the most searched and viewed.<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/video-interviews-to-boost-business-visibility/\" id=\"\">Videos are an excellent way to connect</a> with your readers, share your personality and expand on topics relevant to your consumers.</p><h3 id=\"\">Infographics</h3><p>We see them all over the web. Infographics are powerful and have the ability to draw people in quickly.</p><h3 id=\"\">Be Kind</h3><p>Not all of your feedback will be positive. While it might be tempting to get a little snarky in your reply, avoid rude comebacks.If you have to, walk away and come back later. Always respond with a clear head and a positive mindset.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Connect</h2><h3 id=\"\">Claim Your Handles, Build Your Community and Amplify</h3><p>Make sure everyone can follow you everywhere easily.Whether they spend their time on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter or Pinterest, know where your audience is hanging out and be sure to show up there.</p><h3 id=\"\">Get Face to Face</h3><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Network at events</li>\t<li id=\"\">Link to other bloggers</li>\t<li id=\"\">Comment on your favorite sites</li>\t<li id=\"\">Email your favorite writers and bloggers for a deeper connection</li>\t<li id=\"\">Follow them on Twitter</li>\t<li id=\"\">Attend a blog conference</li>\t<li id=\"\">Offer to guest post on your favorite site or blogs that publish similar content</li>\t<li id=\"\">Perfect your elevator pitch</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h2><p>The benefits of <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/things-you-wish-you-knew-before-you-started-your-blog/\" id=\"\">building your business through blogging</a> are significant. From improved brand awareness to increased reach and profitability, blogging can be a huge boon to your business.But at the end of the day, no blog succeeds overnight. It requires commitment, vision and a willingness to go the extra mile. Even on those days you feel less than inspired.If you're excited to get started, don't let anyone derail your dream.Dive in, have fun and enjoy blogging about what you love!</p><h2 id=\"\">Grab the Infographic Here (and pin it for later)</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222b5c4c4c7d5040fd89_blogging-101-starting-a-blog-and-getting-noticed-infographic_52c58e191a553_w1500.jpeg\" alt=\"Step by Step Guide to a Profitable Small Business Blog\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Infographic courtesy <a href=\"http://visual.ly/blogging-101-so-you-want-start-blog\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Visual.ly</a></p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Are you struggling to make social media work for your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">small business</a>?Still not convinced it's the right place to be?Although most small businesses believe social media can be an effective marketing tool, very few understand how to master it.This ineffective strategy ends up hurting rather than helping business growth.So, where are you falling down within your use of social media?Below are <strong id=\"\">six reasons social media isn’t working for your business </strong>and how to fix it.</p><h1 id=\"\">Why Social Media Isn't Working for Your Business (and how to fix it)</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. You’re a Number Collector</h2><p>As many companies would like to believe that social media is just a numbers game, the truth is the opposite.While chasing fan and follower count might seem logical, the larger the number, the bigger your reach -- it’s counter-intuitive to <strong id=\"\">the true value within social media</strong>.If you want to establish meaningful connections, you must get into the conversation and stop worrying about the numbers.Whether you’re looking to connect with peers, influencers or consumers, the fastest way I know how to establish rapport is through <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/effective-relationship-marketing/\" id=\"\">relationship building</a>.And guess what? There’s no magic in it. You don’t need special tools or fancy skills. All you need is the willingness to get to know people.I challenge you to find five people each day that you can reach out to.</p><h5 id=\"\">Here are a few ways to do that:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Ask a question</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share a story</li> \t<li id=\"\">Talk about a shared interest</li> \t<li id=\"\">See how you can lend a helping hand</li> \t<li id=\"\">Be kind and encouraging</li></ul><p>The key is to not only learn more about your audience, but also gain valuable insight into what makes them tick. Your goal is to <strong id=\"\">be a relationship builder, not just a number collector.</strong>As Dale Carnegie said,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.”</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">2. No System to Keep in Touch</h2><p>If I asked you how you were monitoring your social media mentions, would you have an answer? And if so, could you tell me how to quickly respond in real-time?With <strong id=\"\">70 percent of U.S. households now using the Internet</strong> to shop for local products and services, can your business afford to be absent on social media? The obvious answer is no.Not having a system in place to stay in touch across your social channels can (and most likely will) adversely affect the very relationships you are working to build.Sound complicated? It doesn't have to be.Use a tool like <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com\" id=\"\">Sprout Social</a> and their Smart Inbox to monitor what’s being said in and around your business. A quick reply goes a long way when looking to establish camaraderie.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222b26a4726020a4f1e2_sprout-social-smart-inbox.jpeg\" alt=\"sprout social smart inbox\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">3. No Value Proposition</h2><p>Your social media connections are looking to learn more about you. They want to know what you have to offer. <em id=\"\">They want to know your value proposition.</em>So, what is a <a href=\"http://www.helpscout.net/blog/value-proposition/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">value proposition</a>? As explained by Wikipedia,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"A <em id=\"\">value proposition</em> is a promise of <em id=\"\">value</em> to be delivered and acknowledged and a belief from the customer that <em id=\"\">value</em> will be appealed and experienced.\"</blockquote><p>Now knowing that, could you tell me what you do or how you help people? And if so, would  your answer be short, clear and concise?Not only should you be able to articulate your value easily, but also in a way that makes sense to your audience.</p><h5 id=\"\">A Quick Way to Identify Your Compelling Value Proposition</h5><p>Take a look at your business through the eyes of your consumer and answer a few questions.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What are you offering your audience that changes their lives for the better?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What does your product or service do to enhance or improve their current situation?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What key problem(s) are you solving?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is your product or service unique and compelling?</li></ul><p>I guarantee that if you can clearly communicate your value, you will inspire engagement and ultimately encourage sales.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Lack of a Unique Personality</h2><p>When was the last time you looked at your social media accounts? If your answer was never, then it’s time for a review.Analyze your bio, tweets and posts. How would you view this content if you were a potential client? Are the mission, vision and values of your business clearly stated? Have you taken the opportunity to create your own unique persona or are you a cookie-cutter clone of your competition?Whether you’re shy or concerned about taking a stand, don't be afraid to put yourself out there. People bond with people, not businesses. In order to create better connections, you need to humanize your business.You do this by injecting personality into the online life of your business. Take all of the offline goodness that makes your business special and translate it into a vibrant online persona.As <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GuyKawasaki/posts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Guy Kawasaki</a> says,</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"The goal is to provide inspiring information that moves people to action.\"</blockquote><p>To better <strong id=\"\">understand what differentiates you from the competition</strong> and encourage your audience to take action, answer a few questions.</p><h5 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">KEYS TO DIFFERENTIATION</strong></h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What are you passionate about and what could you talk about all day long?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What’s your specialty?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your top skill or unique ability?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What do you excel at?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What makes you stand out from the competition?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What pain, need or concern can you solve for potential clients?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">5. No Commitment to Consistency</h2><p>Want to create better connections? Stop posting sporadically.Commit to showing up when and where your customers are spending their time online.

First, figure out where your target audience is hanging out and secondly, determine what content they’re looking for on each social network?Since all social media platforms have distinct cultures of their own, your small business needs to optimize content and conversation for each.For example, if you’re a local bakery, your Facebook following might appreciate special offers they’ll only find on your page.

Determine how social media works in tandem with all of your other marketing efforts. Once you're clear about it's purpose, your next step is to put your plan in place.Keep in mind, this should not be an overwhelming process.

From phone calls to email, having a firm grasp on where you're spending your time just makes sense.</p><p id=\"\">But that practice never fully transitioned into the online world.

Use Automation in Moderation</h2><p id=\"\">Automation can be a huge time saver. It can automate repetitive or mundane tasks, increasing efficiency. And if you're using &nbsp;social media to market your business, time is money.</p><p id=\"\">However, automation should never replace the conversation. You never want to push so much out through automation that you take the \"social\" out of social media.</p><p id=\"\">What you can do with automation is schedule upcoming content to maintain a consistent posting schedule. Tools like the <a href=\"http://blog.hootsuite.com/autoschedule/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hootsuite Autoscheduler</a> can help you view your scheduled messages for the day, week, or month, to make sure you fill the gaps between posts.</p><p id=\"\">Whatever the tool you decide on, let it <strong id=\"\">assist you in building relationships</strong> and creating meaningful conversation.

      "wp-yoast-seo-title": " How Beginners Can Build a Better Blog",
      "wp-content": "<p id=\"\">Building your business through blogging is an exciting adventure. It brings with it the freedom to manage your message and offers the visibility many businesses fail to find with any other marketing medium.</p><p id=\"\">The design, content creation and promotion that transpires in order to produce and maintain a superstar blog is exhilarating. </p><p id=\"\">The benefits are improved brand awareness, increased reach and significant financial returns. But at the end of the day, no blog becomes a superstar overnight. </p><p id=\"\">Building a successful blog requires vision, an unfailing commitment to purpose and a willingness to go that extra mile.</p><p id=\"\">It can be easy to lose focus and find yourself sidetracked in the beginning. This makes it imperative that you understand a few key elements that make up a successful and eventually profitable blog.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. Know Your Audience</h2><p id=\"\">When I first started blogging, I struggled to find my purpose. I was a random blogger without consistency. </p><p>I also lacked content that served any one niche in particular. I was spinning on the Ferris Wheel of trepidation and fear. I worried that if I took a stand, I would somehow miss the massive target audience I was seeking.</p><p id=\"\">My mistake was simple and one that many early bloggers make. I did not identify who I was truly looking to reach. I had forgotten the importance of having an intimate understanding of my audience, an awareness of what motivates them and a deep desire to satisfy their needs.</p><p id=\"\">Answer these questions to define your target audience:</p><p id=\"\">- Who does your product or service serve?<br>- Why would those people buy your product or service?<br>- Where is your audience spending their time online?<br>‍</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Superstars Commit to Purpose</h2><p id=\"\">‍<br>Finding the meaning behind what you write may not be something you immediately identify with. This is why it is important to stick with topics you are familiar with. </p><p id=\"\">Take your knowledge, your years of expertise and your passion for your message and put your heart and soul in to each article. If you are longing for a purpose behind your blog, answer a few important questions.</p><p id=\"\">- What drives and excites you?<br>- Where do you see yourself in 5 years?<br>- Is your brand unique?<br>- Is your message clear and powerful?<br>- Do you have a system in place to effectively stay in front of prospects and past clients?<br>‍</p><p id=\"\">A couple of these are soul searching, gut wrenching “why the heck do I get out of bed” questions. Take your time and answer them. Ignoring your answers is a mistake and a regret you will have down the road.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Superstars Are Passionate</h2><p id=\"\">‍<br>Are you passionate about your topics? If you only blog for the search engines, you will quickly lose your enthusiasm for the subject matter. Blogging consistently requires you to be on fire for your topic. Consistency will build authority and credibility, but it will take time.</p><p id=\"\">Writing about your topics should come as natural as breathing. If your content feels forced, your readers will sense that.</p><p id=\"\">I encourage you to perform a small test. Write down the first 10 topics that come to your mind. Then ask yourself if these topics excite you and whether or not they are something that you could write about daily. </p><p id=\"\">If your answer is yes and they are not a part of your blog now, then you need to consider making a change. If not, begin to eliminate the ones you dislike and focus on the top 3 – 5 that knock your socks off.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Superstars Create a Conversation</h2><p id=\"\">‍<br>Do you work daily to engage your readers, draw on their emotions, and ask them to discuss, debate and contact you? Are you asking open ended questions or using free offers or advice to draw them in? Have you defined a call to action and do you ask them to take action on a consistent basis?</p><p id=\"\">If you do not create a conversation then you will never gain an audience that feels a part of your community. Make it feel like home to them. A community where they belong and enjoy spending their time. You also want to create a feeling of loss if they miss an article.</p><p id=\"\">Take a look at your current content and determine how you can drive readers to your blog and engage them consistently. e.g. blogging about hot topics, local information, answering frequently asked questions. Be specific and then take action by adding this to your blog.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Superstars Relate to Their Audience</h2><p id=\"\">‍<br>By continuously offering value to your readers, you create a rhythm and a reason behind your blog. As your readers begin to comment, listen intently to their feedback. What worries or concerns them and where can you meet that need? Craft your content around their most pressing wants and desires.</p><p id=\"\">Remember: your articles should be a refuge, an answer to their problems and a reassuring voice throughout their purchase decision. Give them the information they are searching for in an easy to digest format and they will be forever grateful.</p><p id=\"\">You can turn your blog into the superstar catalyst that drives you toward your goals. Identify your purpose and then write with conviction. Open up your creative flood gates and allow your audience to connect and grow your brand and your bottom line.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

Lets dive in!</p><h1 id=\"\">Instantly Improve Social Media Strategy</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Define Goals</h2><p>Your first order of business is defining your goals. Goals are the fuel that propel your online efforts forward. They give a reason and a purpose to what can otherwise be random, sporadic, one-off <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media tactics</a>.However, the key to goal setting success is knowing what questions to ask and then writing your answers down. Why is this so important?In a study by Dr. Gail Matthews, a psychology professor at Dominican University in California, she found that you are <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/5-reasons-why-you-should-commit-your-goals-to-writing.html\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">42 percent more likely to achieve your goals</a> just by writing them down.So, grab your pen and paper and get writing!</p><h5 id=\"\">Ask these key questions:</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Who are you looking to connect with?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What type of content will you share?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What are you trying to achieve? Additional exposure, connections with potential clients, more sales?</li>\t<li id=\"\">How much time can you commit to managing your social media?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What does success look like?</li></ul><p>My motto has always been,[clickToTweet tweet=\"What you don't write down, doesn’t get done. Capture your #socialmedia goals and review daily. \" quote=\"What doesn’t get written down, doesn’t get done. Capture your social media goals and review daily. \"]</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Stand Out Online</h2><p>In a social media world where a cookie-cutter approach is the norm, creating differentiation is a must.In my book, “<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-domination/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">10 Ways to Use Social Media to Virtually Crush the Competition</a>,” I share the <strong id=\"\">key component that should always be at the top of your strategy, </strong>it's sharing your “one thing.”It’s that one thing that sets you apart from your competitors and leaves an indelible mark in the mind of your potential clients.<strong id=\"\">Focus on what your customer wants.</strong> Ask yourself everyday whether your message is beneficial and valuable or just contributing to the noise.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282229f487592399aea24b_stand-out-online.jpeg\" alt=\"stand out online\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Know Your Audience</h2><p>As you go about your day on social media, do you have a defined focus? Have you taken the time to truly understand the needs of your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">target market</a>?Now is the time to dig in and do some research. Do your homework and get to know who that potential client or consumer is, and be specific.The better you can describe that person, the more likely it is that your message and vision will capture their attention.Here’s a quick way to get inside the head of your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">target market</a>.</p><h5 id=\"\">YOUR THREE TARGET MARKETS MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS:</h5><ol id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Parents of teens</li>\t<li id=\"\">Parents of newborns</li>\t<li id=\"\">Parents of college students</li></ol><p>As you can imagine, the problems you solve for each one will be considerably different.

Create a Cross-Platform Strategy</h2><p>Companies <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/master-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">succeeding at social media</a> today know where their time is best spent. They also know that different <strong id=\"\">demographic groups use social media in distinctive ways</strong>.Take the time to research and understand exactly how, when and why your audience is using social media. Where are they spending their time and how can you best use that social network to support your goals?Dependent on your target market, you might want to focus on Facebook or Twitter. However, you might find that expanding into Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, or LinkedIn is a better conversational tool.The bottom line? It’s vital to <strong id=\"\">identify your customers preferred social media platform</strong> so that your strategy is focused and direct.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282229f487597389aea248_integrated-social-media-strategy.jpeg\" alt=\"integrated social media strategy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Translate Your Established Brand</h2><p>Your online presence is an extension of your offline brand.

Track, Measure and Adjust</h2><p><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/measure-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Tracking and measuring</a> your efforts should be the backbone of your social media strategy. But as a business owner or entrepreneur, you’re busy running a company. The idea is to make measurement and tracking as easy as possible.While social media is useful in so many ways, it can also be an enormous time suck if we don’t pay close attention to where our time and efforts are best spent. That’s where analysis comes in.Leverage information available to you in Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, your Google Plus dashboard and any third-party management tool you’re using to learn as much as possible about which content is making the biggest splash across your social channels.Evaluate <strong id=\"\">how and why</strong> some content works and some falls short.<strong id=\"\">Not everything will work.

      "wp-content": "<p>Are you trying to <strong id=\"\">build a successful blog</strong>? Does it feel like an uphill battle?When I first started blogging, I had so many questions. I suspect that you do too.Last week I was lucky enough to join Denise Wakeman on her show, <a href=\"http://denisewakeman.com/adventures-in-visibility-free-hangouts/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Adventures in Visibility</a>, where we talked about blogging and its power when leveraged effectively.Below are <strong id=\"\">forty things you wish you knew before starting a blog</strong>.Whether you're new to blogging or looking to improve your results, these tips will help you boost your blog performance and effectiveness!</p><h1 id=\"\">40 Things You Wish You Knew Before Starting a Blog</h1><h4 id=\"\">1. Your Purpose</h4><p>If I asked you why you were blogging, could you answer? You have to know why you're using a blog to market your business before you can make it a success.Ask yourself why you write, what purpose it serves and how your blog will support your overall marketing goals.</p><h4 id=\"\">2. Commitment Matters</h4><p>Get clear on your blogging commitment. Know <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/profitable-blog-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">how often you can blog </a>and stick with it. Knowing this will allow you to stay consistent. Because consistency can be a deal killer.Think about it. When was the last time you revisited a blog that wasn’t recently updated? Probably never. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by making this big mistake.</p><h4 id=\"\">3. Take a Look at the Competition</h4><p>Do your competitive research and learn what’s working for your competition and what’s not. Find holes within their strategy and fill them. A great big audience is dying to hear what you have to say.If you want to <strong id=\"\">leverage your competition</strong>, read this post from Debra Trappen, a Business Consultant with D11 Consulting, and find <a target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">six ways</a> you can get to know them...fast!</p><h4 id=\"\">4. Research Keywords</h4><p>Research the top keywords and phrases that your audience is using to find you. That’s valuable insight you don’t want to overlook. Take the guesswork out of your research and use tools like <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\" id=\"\">Google Keyword Planner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.semrush.com/\" id=\"\">SEMRush</a>.</p><h4 id=\"\">5. Clearly Identify Your Topic</h4><p>Get focused on your topic. What are you passionate about? You'll burn out quickly if you don’t write what fires you up and gets you excited.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tool Tip</h5><p>Once you identify your topic, use a tool like <a href=\"https://app.buzzsumo.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">BuzzSumo</a> to find top-performing content. Identify what's resonating within your industry and then lend your voice to that topic. Figure out how you can write about it, but with your unique point of view.</p><h4 id=\"\">6. Write Down Your Goals</h4><p>What doesn’t get written down doesn’t get done. Write down your goals, identify your desired outcome, and celebrate your milestones.</p><h4 id=\"\">7. Get Crystal Clear on Your Audience</h4><p>If I asked you who your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/4-simple-steps-content-marketing-success/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">target market</a> is, would you know the answer? (Hint: the answer is not everyone) To succeed, you need to know who you’re talking to.Have a deep understanding of your market and what they’re looking for. Don’t assume you have the answers. <strong id=\"\">Do your homework.</strong></p><h5 id=\"\">Tool Tip</h5><p><a href=\"http://socialmention.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Mention</a> is a nifty tool with a ton of functionality that will help you get to know your audience. Dissect, analyze and research content based on keyword, phrase or Twitter handle.Begin by looking at your industry-specific keywords and then drill down into the blogs, tweets, and posts that pull up in the stream of most recent content shared.</p><h4 id=\"\">8. Niche Down</h4><p>As the saying goes, \"the riches are in the niches,\" and it's absolutely true. If you want to grow your blog, you need to niche down. As I mentioned above, get crystal clear about your target market.Talking to everybody means you’re speaking to nobody. Show your readers how much you care by researching who they are and what it is that matters most to them.</p><h4 id=\"\">9. Speak to an Audience of One</h4><p>Make your message targeted and designed for your perfect buyer, client, or consumer. Identify your core reader and understand what they're looking for when they land on your blog.</p><h5 id=\"\">How to Identify Your Core Reader</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Put yourself in the shoes of your target market. What challenges do they face, what questions do they have, and what problems do you solve?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your competition talking about? Does that seem relevant to your audience?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Now look to the Internet. Research keywords and phrases that your audience would type in if they were looking for your product or service.</li></ul><h4 id=\"\">10. Know Your Limitations</h4><p>What are you willing to talk about, and what are taboo topics? Knowing you're limitations will make it easy to stick within those boundaries.For many, there are moral or religious reasons for staying away from certain topics. Whatever the case is for you, know them before you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation.</p><h4 id=\"\">11. Create a Content Calendar</h4><p>I live and die by my <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">editorial calendar</a>. I am a checklist girl and what isn’t on the list doesn’t get done. That holds true in my business and flows through to my blog and social media. Create a calendar and map out specific topics like:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Company milestones</li> \t<li id=\"\">Upcoming events</li> \t<li id=\"\">Hot topics</li> \t<li id=\"\">Industry news</li> \t<li id=\"\">Core values</li></ul><h4 id=\"\">12. Never Stop Learning</h4><p>Never stop learning and growing as a blogger. Become an avid reader and find ways to improve your blogging abilities.Write daily and know that <strong id=\"\">every word better connects you to your audience</strong>. Be a student of your craft and learn from others who are succeeding within in your industry or field. Then take that knowledge and make it your own, unique to you.</p><h4 id=\"\">13. Edit Ruthlessly</h4><p>Take your time to spell check and review your article before you post. Eliminate any needless words or phrases. Keep it short and to the point, removing any adjectives or adverbs that only belabor a sentence.If you struggle with grammar, pass the review to a colleague or <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/grow-your-business/\" id=\"\">Virtual Assistant</a>.</p><h4 id=\"\">14. Make Your Content Easy to Read</h4><p>While it might be typical to talk in industry jargon within your office, don't make it a habit on your blog. Using fancy words or terminology doesn't make you sound smarter; it leaves your readers scratching their heads.Speak their language and make your content easier to read with a tool like <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hemmingway</a>. Simply copy and paste your post, then look for your score for guidance. Update the misspellings, grammatical errors, or complexities in a matter of moments.</p><h4 id=\"\">15. Rework Your Opening Paragraph</h4><p>You have one chance to grab your reader’s attention. Don’t miss the opportunity to craft an opening to your blog post that seizes your audience’s attention from the moment they land on your blog.Take these tips from Copyblogger to <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/5-simple-ways-to-open-your-blog-post-with-a-bang/\" id=\"\">open your blog post with a bang</a>:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Ask a question.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share an anecdote or quote.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Invoke the mind’s eye.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use an analogy, metaphor, or simile</li> \t<li id=\"\">Cite a shocking statistic.</li></ul><h4 id=\"\">16. Walk Away</h4><p>Ever find yourself staring at the screen, longing for inspiration? Yep, me too. At that point, it's time to take a break. Get up, stretch, walk around the block, and grab a cup of coffee. Whatever you do, relax your mind and your body for a few minutes. It will do wonders for your creative juices, I promise!</p><h4 id=\"\">17. Offer an Enormous Amount of Value</h4><p>Don't be afraid to give away your knowledge and years of experience. Take the advice of Pauline Cabrera, the savvy mind behind <a href=\"http://www.twelveskip.com/marketing/content-marketing/278/7-easy-but-proven-ways-on-how-to-create-content-that-goes-viral\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">TwelveSkip</a>,</p><blockquote id=\"\">An article will spread naturally if people can learn something from it. If the content contains information that readers can use in their lives, then the article will be read by a lot of people. When you write your articles, make sure that you’re providing useful, well-researched, and credible information.</blockquote><h4 id=\"\">18. Give a Sneak Peek Into Your World</h4><p>Let people into your day. Share what you do to help customers and how you've solved their problems. Give unique insight into your industry or niche that allows your readers to make an educated decision.We all love to see behind the scenes. Your readers are no different and will appreciate the chance to get to know you better.</p><h4 id=\"\">19. Build Relationships with Fellow Bloggers</h4><p>Build relationships with other like-minded bloggers. Go beyond the four walls of your blog and create conversations across other networks, including social media.Join blog groups that have created Tribes of individuals who share the same interests and will support spreading your message. My top resource is <a href=\"http://triberr.com/\" id=\"\">Triberr</a> – an amazing community designed to amplify your message and expand your reach. I’m also a big fan of <a href=\"http://socialbuzzclub.com/\" id=\"\">Social Buzz Club</a>. You find/connect with your fav bloggers, add your blog and start sharing others' content!</p><h4 id=\"\">20. Build Relationships, Not Numbers</h4><p>I understand that your blog's purpose is to draw potential clients in, but bashing them over the head with boring stats and constant promotional ads is not the way to <strong id=\"\">build relationships</strong>.Your blog audience wants you to woo them. They want to get to know you and understand how you can solve their problems. Share your value, but do it in a conversational way.</p><h4 id=\"\">21. Build Your List</h4><p>One of the biggest mistakes I made initially was not building my list. I had a list I'd built within my business, but not one specifically centered around my blog. Don't make that same mistake.If you want to get the word out about your blog, building a list is a great way to do it. Write amazing content that goes out to just your email subscribers. Get them excited and involved in your marketing efforts.</p><h4 id=\"\">22. Schedule Your Marketing Time</h4><p>Promotion is almost a bigger part of your blog than writing your posts. Commit time to get the word out. Create separate images for all social networks to match each size requirement.</p><h4 id=\"\">23. Use Eye-Catching Graphics</h4><p>Use images to create brand awareness and as an instant identifier. Be recognizable! Use the same layout, font, and design to connect people to your company better. Allow people to connect with you and that essence that makes your business special.</p><h4 id=\"\">24. Create Graphics Specific to the Social Network</h4><p>I create separate images for all social networks to match each requirement. For example, if you’re using images on Twitter, ensure that you’re creating them correctly.<a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick,</a> a Social Media Strategist who consistently uses images in a creative and highly effective way offers this advice,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“The best size to use for Twitter graphics and images is 1024 pixels by 512 pixels. Batch your images and create a design template.  This makes it easy to quickly create a series of tweet graphics that are ready to use when you need them.\"</blockquote><h4 id=\"\">25. Find Content Everywhere</h4><p>One of the top questions I'm asked is, \"where do I find blog topics?\" My answer? Content is everywhere! It's wherever you go, whatever you do, and in every conversation you have. Begin to look at everything as potential content for your blog.Did a client ask a question that your readers might find interesting? Answer it and then offer advice on what best to do. It will position you as an expert and an authority on the topic.</p><h4 id=\"\">26. Use What You Have</h4><p>Look around at all of your current marketing collateral. Everything from old newsletters to emails can be <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/breathe-new-life-into-old-blog-content/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">repurposed to become fresh content</a>. Why reinvent the wheel when you have everything you need right at your fingertips?</p><h4 id=\"\">27. Create Content by Listening</h4><p>Listen to your readers. Comb through their questions and find ways to solve problems. Offering a <strong id=\"\">substantial amount of value</strong> builds trust and will establish you as the industry authority.  Remember, trust takes time and will not happen overnight.</p><h4 id=\"\">28. Find Your Own Groove</h4><p>While understanding your competition is smart, watching their every step can be unhealthy. Stop mimicking everything your competition is doing.

Join the Conversation</h4><p>The single most effective way to build loyalty and trust is through conversation.  A blog allows readers to get to know you on a very intimate level.

Know Your Market</h2><p>Now that you know not everyone is your ultimate customer or client, your first step is to define who they are. This is where you're going to get hyper-specific.You're going to build a customer persona and identify what problems you solve. Then determine what solutions you can provide to ease their pain, make their life easier or simplify the buying process.</p><h5 id=\"\">How to Get to Know Your Market</h5><p><strong id=\"\">First realize...</strong></p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">You must be laser beam focused when describing your market.</li> \t<li id=\"\">It's easier to earn business through targeted marketing.</li> \t<li id=\"\">It’s great to get into the heads of your potential buyers, but even better to get into their hearts.</li> \t<li id=\"\">You'll need to put yourself in the shoes of your buyer to truly understand their needs.</li></ul><p><strong id=\"\">Now get clear on who they are...</strong>Want to get to know your consumer? Here's a great example from <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-blueprint-ht\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Hubspo</a>t. The buyer persona below is Marketing Mary, a representation of their target market.As you can see, they've included important details about her goals, challenges, and why she would want to connect with the company. You can mimic this breakdown, using it as a guide to get clear on who you're speaking with.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282229e23a16bd173c7746_hubspot-buyer-persona.jpeg\" alt=\"hubspot buyer persona\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Identify the Purpose of Your Content</h2><p>Identifying the purpose of your content marketing is your next step. Your purpose should include clearly set goals, a mission, vision and objectives.A strongly defined purpose will give you a clear understanding of who you're writing for and why. Always ensure that your content purpose is in alignment with the overall core objectives, and marketing strategy, of your business.To do this, understand the needs of your target market and the problems you solve. Below are two steps to help you get started.</p><h5 id=\"\">Know the Problems You Solve</h5><h4 id=\"\">Step 1:</h4><p>Create your buyer or audience persona – know their exact demographics, needs, wants and desires. (see above)</p><h5 id=\"\">Know the Value You Bring</h5><h4 id=\"\">Step 2:</h4><p>Answer the questions below –</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What is your skill set, area of expertise or specialized experience?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What can you teach or train others to do?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What resources, tools or information can you share that will</li> \t<li id=\"\">improve the lives of your audience?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Does your product, service, tool or system fill a void within your industry?</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  3. Commit to Quality, Not Quantity</h2><p>While it should go without saying, it's always worth repeating. Great content is the core of your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/master-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a> and content marketing strategy.To ensure the <strong id=\"\">quality of your content</strong>, determine your process for producing, polishing and publishing it. How frequently will you post and how much time can you commit to marketing that content?Keep in mind that the quality of your content is a direct reflection on your business. This isn't an area where you want to over commit and under deliver.Create a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">content calendar</a> to keep you focused and on track. There's nothing worse than putting a content marketing strategy in place only to get derailed by a lack of planning. As Winston Churchill said,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“He who fails to <em id=\"\">plan</em> is <em id=\"\">planning to fail</em>\"</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  4. Pay Attention to What's Working (and what's not)</h2><p>Ever wish you could <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-super-powers/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">see directly into the thoughts of your potential buyer</a>? Wouldn’t it be great if you knew exactly what they wanted and then could provide it every time?You can, or at least you can come close by paying attention to your analytics, metrics and goals.Numbers don’t lie and will always give you the guidance and direction you need. Measure your conversations, interaction, engagement, and shares through tools like:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Google Analytics</li> \t<li id=\"\">Sprout Social</li> \t<li id=\"\">Hootsuite</li> \t<li id=\"\">Buffer</li></ul><p>Know what content is hitting the mark and what's a miss. The bottom line is that no matter what tool you use to measure your content marketing efforts, you must commit to a review process.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Know Your Sales Process (and Call to Action)</h2><p>Before you can create an effective social media content marketing strategy, you need to know your sales process. How do you move people through your marketing funnel and where is client acquisition actually happen?<strong id=\"\">Ask yourself a few questions...</strong></p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What actions are you taking daily that produce results?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Where are your leads coming from?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are they the right type of leads?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do your leads convert?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How are you using social to support your sales process?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are you using a clear Call to Action (CTA) in all of your content?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Have you tested each of your CTA's to determine what's converting?</li></ul><p>Once you know the answer to this, you can clearly <strong id=\"\">articulate your value and the next steps you want consumers to take</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>There are many benefits to defining your niche and speaking directly to their needs.How can you better position your business across social media to welcome new customers?

You have a habit of doubting yourself. Aren’t you so sick and f*cking tired of doubting yourself? Aren’t you exhausted by how often you hesitate, second-guess, question or doubt your worth? It’s time to break this pattern. By recognizing that self doubt is a pattern, you can break it. It doesn’t matter if you learned to doubt yourself because of your mother, your father, a bully, a sh*tty boss, or a toxic girlfriend- how you got it is less important than how you’ll break it because patterns aren’t personal, they’re just patterns. I believe that if you break a pattern, you free the person. Imagine if you started cheering for yourself...

      "wp-content": "<p>Building an <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/supercharge-social-media/\" id=\"\">effective social media presence</a> can be a daunting task.While many tout the importance of social media, embracing the benefits is often easier said than done.But yet, business owners and entrepreneurs know that it's no longer a matter of whether they should use social media. It's <strong id=\"\">how to use it effectively</strong> and without fail.While there's no fast track to mastering social media, there are ways to <strong id=\"\">become proficient</strong> in a shorter amount of time.If you're ready to maximize your online potential, the twelve tips below will help you engage your audience, no matter the social network! Plus, <strong id=\"\">grab the Slidedeck</strong> that includes tips from my latest presentation.</p><h1 id=\"\">12 Steps to Master Social Media</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Choose Your Channel</h2><p>Facebook, Google Plus, and other social networks allow you to interact with potential clients. You can also find your next job, shop, sell, buy, auction and exchange just about anything you can think of.No matter your reason for <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-presence/\" id=\"\">using social media</a>, make sure you choose your main networks wisely.Choose <strong id=\"\">one or two social networks</strong> that allow for the greatest exposure and then use them daily. We all know time is money. There's no sense in starting something if you're not going to consistently stick around.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Define Your Target Market</h2><p>Do you know who your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-tactics/\" id=\"\">target audience</a> is? Have you identified your specific area of expertise?Don’t try to cater to everyone by being all things to all people. If you want to reach the right audience, your content should be hyper-specific. Write your posts and speak directly to their wants, needs and desires.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Share Appealing Content</h2><p>Sharing content in an appealing way is tougher than it seems. How often have you stumbled on a post or tweet that left you shaking your head at an opportunity lost?Share <strong id=\"\">interesting, relevant and insightful content</strong> and share it often. This is the single best way to establish your expertise and credibility.You have knowledge others need. Give it away freely!</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Listen and Respond</h2><p>While social media is an excellent communication tool, it is also a very beneficial listening tool.As you listen to your customers, <strong id=\"\">take time to truly hear what their needs</strong>, wants and desires are. Then work to fulfill those needs with your content, time, compassion and genuine feedback.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Establish Your Genuine Voice</h2><p>People want to get to know the real you. Social media gives you the opportunity to share your authentic voice, no matter the format.Whether you are tweeting or posting to Facebook, <strong id=\"\">add context around the content you are sharing</strong>. This provides unique insight into who you are and what makes you tick.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Don’t Rely on Automation</h2><p>While I love automation, I also know that you never want to rely on it so heavily that your personality gets lost.Always <strong id=\"\">use automation in moderation</strong>. It should never replace you or your ability to get “social.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Join the Conversation</h2><p>Don’t hide in the shadows. The only way to connect with others and create meaningful relationships is to <strong id=\"\">get into the conversation</strong>.Ask a question, provide feedback or offer your thoughts around someone’s shared content.Make your presence known!</p><h2 id=\"\">  8. Commit to Your Social Media Strategy</h2><p>Practice makes perfect and a commitment to your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/solid-social-media-strategy/\" id=\"\">social media strategy</a> is essential.Consistency builds trust. It also allows you to create a workable, sustainable and successful plan.Execute, execute, execute!</p><h2 id=\"\">  9. Take Social Media Seriously</h2><p>Just like any other marketing campaign, building a <strong id=\"\">successful social media presence</strong> takes time.Commit to a specific level of interaction and engagement. Design your day knowing that each post or interaction drives you closer to your marketing goals.</p><h2 id=\"\">  10. Don’t Overlook Your Blog</h2><p>Social media can be a <strong id=\"\">boost to online credibility</strong>, but it cannot replace the value a blog brings to your business and personal brand.It should be one part of an integrated marketing plan. Determine how often you will post to your blog and use that content to repurpose across your social channels.</p><h2 id=\"\">  11. Measure the Impact of Your Efforts</h2><p>As the saying goes,</p><blockquote id=\"\">A goal without a plan is just a wish.</blockquote><p>So it is with social media marketing as well.If you're <strong id=\"\">posting daily without a plan</strong>, you are wishing for results, not planning for them.</p><h2 id=\"\">  12. Analyze and Adjust</h2><p>Once you have put systems in place to measure your success, you now need to analyze your progress.Identify what is working and adjust what is not. A successful social media strategy is an agile one.</p><h3 id=\"\">Your Turn</h3><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">I’d love to hear from you!

Whatever the case, the effective use of social media can confuse even the most seasoned business marketer.But the good news is this.No matter what stage you’re in, you can reinvent your online presence.Make a few tweaks to <strong id=\"\">shift your use of social media</strong> and immediately improve your results.</p><h1 id=\"\">10 Social Media Tactics</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Establish a Plan</h2><p>Your first step is to establish a strategic <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/solid-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media marketing plan</a>. This should include goals, objectives and key success indicators.What are you hoping to achieve? What does success look like? You can’t start <strong id=\"\">using social media to market your business</strong> until you understand its purpose and value.Once you know what you want to get out of social media, now you can determine what to put into it. Create an <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-and-manage-an-editorial-calendar/\" id=\"\">editorial calendar</a> to keep your posting consistent.</p><h5 id=\"\">Why use an editorial calendar in your business?</h5><p><a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Co-Schedule</a> suggests that like a traditional editorial calendar, your social media calendar should:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Provide a place to generate post ideas and key topics.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Assign writing and other editorial tasks to key members of your team.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create a publishing schedule that helps you maintain a consistent presence.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Allow you to visualize your marketing strategy in a way that everyone can understand.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Act as a communication point to team members.</li></ul><p>Let your editorial calendar act as a daily roadmap, providing <strong id=\"\">strategic guidance on what and when you will post</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2.

While social media makes it easier than ever to connect with the right audience, its key to understand their needs.To truly make the most of social media, first get into the head of your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-marketing-strategy/\" id=\"\">target market</a>. Who are they, why are they spending their time online and what need does your product, service or system fill?Knowing their \"why\" will allow you to speak to it. Your next step is to create a persona based on your target market. Outline their exact specifications. This should include gender, nationality, industry/work/vocation, and location.As you post to your <strong id=\"\">social media channels,</strong> envision the person you're talking to.

Be a Resource</h2><p>If you want to <strong id=\"\">connect with your perfect customer</strong>, you need to become a valuable resource.

The better you share your company story, the more your audience can connect on an intimate level.</li></ol><h2 id=\"\">  4. Choose Your Channels</h2><p>Just like customers, not every social network is right for your business. That means you need to identify where your customers spend their time online.Would you like to know whether they're on Facebook, Google+ or Twitter?

      "wp-content": "<p>Can your audience separate you from the competition?When you post content to your blog or <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/measure-social-media/\" id=\"\">social networks</a>, are you easily identifiable?Without a doubt, creating differentiation is tough. While success online has many factors, one thing is for sure. You must create a memorable brand.I recently had the opportunity to join <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RobertRyandotie/posts\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Robert Ryan</a> and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115124864391789940258\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Carolyn Capern</a> on \"Blogging Warfare\" to discuss the art of standing out in a sea of noise.Whether you're an entrepreneur or small business owner, finding your voice online can feel overwhelming.Below you'll find ten ways to help you own your industry and stand out online.</p><h1 id=\"\">Tips to Help You Stand Out Online</h1><h2 id=\"\">1. Don’t Speak to Everyone</h2><p>Want to know a secret? Not everyone is your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/supercharge-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">perfect client</a>.Whether you're a small business owner or online marketer, <strong id=\"\">knowing your niche and speaking to it</strong> will save you time, money and headaches.Why? Because speaking the language of your target audience means you tailor your message to a specific audience.I challenge you to stop shouting to an audience of none and connect with an audience of one.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Identify Your Customers Problem Points</h2><p>Do you know the challenges your potential clients face? What struggles are they dealing with daily?Identify your <strong id=\"\">customers pain points</strong> and what problems you can solve.Get into the mind of your customer and understand how your product or service can make their life easier or better.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Know Your Market</h2><p>Once you know your potential market, you can better craft your content. Take your knowledge, expertise, and experience and share it in a way that resonates with your target market.<strong id=\"\">Understand your community</strong> and also the platform. What you share on your blog might be different than what you share on Instagram.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Get Back to Basics</h2><p>As the online world has evolved, so have marketing tactics. Every day there's a new tool, application or strategy to implement.<strong id=\"\">Get off the roller coaster</strong> and back to basics. Choose the top one hundred people that will dramatically impact your business. Now connect with them in a real and meaningful way.From there, keep it simple. Stay in touch, get to know what they like, need and enjoy. Blogging and <strong id=\"\">social media doesn't have to be difficult</strong>. Keep it simple, focused and streamlined.</p><h2 id=\"\">5. Create Meaningful Conversations</h2><p>Want to know <strong id=\"\">what matters to your audience</strong>? Ask them and then listen (really listen) to their answers.Creating a client for life is not about collecting numbers or business cards. Likewise, building relationships online is not about gaming the system to generate numbers or results. It's about making meaningful connections. It's about building relationships and giving without the expectation of receiving something in return. <br><br>The bottom line, when you <strong id=\"\">focus on creating meaningful conversations</strong>, is that you connect with the right people.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. Speak Your Customers Language</h2><p>While you might enjoy using industry jargon, your audience doesn't want to hear it. In fact, using jargon-laden terms and phrases can actually turn your readers off.Sarah Skerik, PR Newswire’s Vice President of Social Media, contends that <a href=\"http://blog.prnewswire.com/2011/01/07/jargon-isnt-just-boring-its-risky/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">jargon isn't just boring, it's risky</a>. Not only do you immediately lack credibility, but also appear anti-social. So, stop it.Strike the jargon from your vocabulary and talk from your heart. Say what you mean, and stop relying on boring, overused words that do nothing more than put your audience to sleep.</p><h2 id=\"\">7. Don’t Use Fancy Fonts</h2><p>Integrating visuals into your marketing creates <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/build-a-sensational-personal-brand/\" id=\"\">brand consistency</a>. It also connects your offline and online marketing, creating a seamless look and feel.If you haven't determined your brand message and voice, ask yourself a few questions. Are you fun, and do you give off that vibe in your conversations and content, or are you serious and professional at all times?Now translate those qualities along with your mission, vision and values into a visual format.While <strong id=\"\">visuals can capture attention</strong>, they can also hurt your brand if they're not done right. Don't get crazy with the colors, pictures and fonts. My rule of thumb is to always keep it clean, concise and simple.</p><h2 id=\"\">8. Monetize Your Blog</h2><p>As a blogger, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/monetize-social-media/\" id=\"\">monetization</a> is typically at the top of your to-do list.If you're eager to make a living from your blog, don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.</p><h5 id=\"\">What steps should you begin to take immediately?</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Know on your market, keywords and topics.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Have a clear call to action.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Understand your marketing funnel. If your audience reads a blog or social media post, what's the next step?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Get social and determine what social networks will help you reach your target market.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Build your list and take your list seriously.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Take yourself seriously. If you don't own your expertise, your audience definitely won't.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">9. Focus on Quality Over Quantity</h2><p>There's no hidden message behind this one. Focus on <strong id=\"\">producing quality content,</strong> and not on the quantity you can pump out.Just as in business, you never want to over promise and under deliver. Know how much content you can commit to producing. Create a content calendar and plan accordingly.Quality work stems from creativity, and creativity stems from a prepared mind.Know your audience, know your topics, know your posting strategy.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. Don’t Lose Momentum</h2><p>Ask yourself one question: what do you have more of - time or money? Now determine where your time is best spent daily.If it's not on creating content or images for your blog or social networks, give it away.Some talented professionals do content creation and <a href=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">graphic design</a>.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>Creating differentiation and standing out online takes commitment.If you want to grow your reach and presence, focus on the steps that will take you there. Tackle one at a time and keep kicking that ball forward.What can you do today that will make a difference for your business tomorrow?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822288fbcbe4d7dc06310_Branding-Tips-from-Rebekah-Radice-Infographic-Blogging-Warfare.jpeg\" alt=\"\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure>",

Eager to finally <strong id=\"\">monetize your online efforts</strong>?Below is summary of our conversation and the <a href=\"http://slidesha.re/1qJPaK5%20\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Slideshare</a>, plus a few additional tools to help you stay focused and on track!</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Supercharge Social Media</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Make a Plan</h2><p>When it comes to growing your business on social media, business owners have a variety of excuses.Whether it’s a lack of time or money, both become obstacles to monetization.</p><h4 id=\"\">\"To profit from social media, you have to invest in social media.\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" id=\"\">Tweet</a></h4><p>What are you losing by not having a plan and system to manage your social media actions and interactions?</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">You don’t have a consistent stream of prospects.</li>\t<li id=\"\">You are wasting time and money collecting friends and followers.</li>\t<li id=\"\">You are working your social media vs. having social media work for you.</li>\t<li id=\"\">You spend all your energy focused on getting new business vs. serving those you’ve already connected with.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  2. Measure Your Success</h2><h4 id=\"\">\"If you don't measure things you can't move things forward.\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" id=\"\">Tweet</a></h4><p>In a survey by <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/259334/ability-to-measure-social-media-marketing-roi-worldwide/\" id=\"\">Statista,</a> 36 percent of respondents said they don't know how to measure social media ROI.Think about it. When was the last time you looked into your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/measure-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media analytics</a>?Are you tracking likes, shares, comments and +1’s? Are you checking your <strong id=\"\">time spent on social media vs. the results received</strong>?You <strong id=\"\">can't manage what you don't measure</strong> and what you don’t measure can quickly get lost in the noise.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Track Your Average Client Acquisition Cost</h2><p>Are you currently tracking your client acquisition costs? Do you know what an average client in the first year is worth to your business?While business models vary, client acquisition principles are always the same.If you can’t measure where the lead originated and what the cost to gain that lead is, you can’t manage, tweak it and move it forward.</p><h5 id=\"\"> Two things you need to do –</h5><ol id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Identify where your clients are coming from. There isn’t a “one size fits all” conversation when it comes to social channels. What resonates with your Facebook community might fall flat on <a href=\"http://smallbiztrends.com/2014/02/ways-use-linkedin-for-lead-generation.html\" id=\"\">LinkedIn</a> or Google+. Know your audience and which social network is sending referrals your way.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Once you understand where your clients are coming from, you can get hyper-focused on tailoring your message to that community. You can spend more time there, but in a strategic, laser-beam focused way.</li></ol><h2 id=\"\">  4. Analyze Your Results</h2><p>Are you consistently reviewing what you’re doing on social media and what you’re doing without fail that’s generating real results?</p><h5 id=\"\">Analysis Allows You To:</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Clearly see what’s perception and what’s reality.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Gives you a firm handle on where your leads are coming from.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Determine whether those leads are benefiting your business or just creating busy work.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Which leads (if any) are converting?</li>\t<li id=\"\">What content is resonating and the result it has on your bottom line.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/measure-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social media analysis</a> consists of monitoring key metrics.</p><h5 id=\"\">An example of metrics you track</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Referrals from social channels.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Leads coming from your Google+ or Facebook page.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Mentions across social media.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Audience/community growth.</li>\t<li id=\"\">New blog subscribers.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  5. Become an Expert Networker</h2><p>Have you ever walked into a networking event and immediately started shouting details about your business? Of course not. Can you imagine what the response might be?I would think that most would turn and walk away. Why? No one is interested in being sold.They want to get to know you and they need to know that you've taken an interest in who they are.The problem is, most people show up to any social networking site, screaming about their business. They blast out their products and services, never taking the time to get to know their fans and followers.</p><h5 id=\"\">Typical Networking Fails</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">More concerned about promotion than the people.</li>\t<li id=\"\">You show up and throw up. (no listening involved)</li>\t<li id=\"\">Focused on getting business, not building relationships.</li></ul><h5 id=\"\"> Why You Stink at Networking</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">You fall down on the follow-up.</li>\t<li id=\"\">You're not clear about who you help and what problems you solve.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Consistent efforts vs. one-off tactics. (you think one social network or tactic is a social media marketing strategy)</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  6. Stop Collecting “People”</h2><p>While we don't collect business cards online, we do collect friends, followers and fans.But, what are those friends or “business cards” actually worth?Let's imagine for a moment that each of your connections were worth $1000. Now think what that would mean to your bottom line if you could truly tap into those connections and leverage your relationships?Dr. Ivan Misner, the Founder &amp; Chairman of <a href=\"http://bni.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">BNI</a>, the world’s largest business networking organization, says you only need <strong id=\"\">four referral sources to succeed.</strong></p><h5 id=\"\">Top Referral Sources</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Staff members – because no one understands your product or service better than someone who works for you</li>\t<li id=\"\">People you’ve give referrals to in the past</li>\t<li id=\"\">Anyone who has given you a referral in the past</li>\t<li id=\"\">Your community – people that are connected to you and already know, like and trust you.</li></ul><p>Engage your top referrers and help them share your story. There's nothing better than a third-party referral that can edify you and your business.Make a commitment to <strong id=\"\">stop collecting, and start contributing</strong>. It's the relationships, not the numbers, that matter.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Use a Daily Monetization Checklist</h2><p>Can you begin to see how a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/solid-social-media-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media strategy</a> that includes relationship building could change the scope of your business?So here’s your quick, down and dirty 8-step checklist.</p><h5 id=\"\">Daily Monetization Checklist</h5><ol id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Make it your goal to build relationships, not just collect people or followers.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Connect with 16 people per month for the purpose of GIVING. Your goals are to build a relationship, not sell your services. That opportunity will come once you’ve earned the right to pitch your business.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Use your online contacts, social channels and networking efforts to locate those 16 people. Who have you been meaning to reach out to or get to know better?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Follow up with each contact at least 8 times. Why? In 2007 it took 3 attempts to get your message through to someone, today that’s increased to 8 times. Don’t give up!</li>\t<li id=\"\">Make great use of personal thank you cards. Take an interest in their interests; get to know what makes them tick. Be personal in all of your communication.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Slow down. Sometimes, in order to speed up you have to SLOW DOWN. Stop pushing things to happen and know that relationships take time.</li>\t<li id=\"\">Create a strategy checklist that outlines your follow-up. How will you interact and reach out to these 16 people consistently? What will you do to stay top of mind?</li>\t<li id=\"\">Rinse and Repeat. In order to succeed, you must continue to expand your network and improve your relationships. Don’t stop your business building efforts!</li></ol><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>What are you doing every day without fail?

Identify Goals and Objectives</h2><p>Have you identified why you’re on social media? If not, success will always feel out of reach.Take the time to know what you hope to gain from <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/succeeding-at-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media</a> and what you have to offer.It’s a noisy online world. The last thing you need to do is to simply hop on without a clear appreciation of your overall goals.The best way to do this is to spell out your goals and objectives. In other words, what are you looking to gain and why is it important to your business?Use a worksheet like the one below from <a href=\"http://www.exacttarget.com/sites/exacttarget/files/How-to-Develop-a-Social-Media-Strategy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Exact Target</a> to get specific.

Humanize Your Business or Brand</h2><p>Social media has the amazing ability to <a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/9-ways-to-humanize-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">humanize your brand</a>.  You can put a face, voice and personality behind your online persona.While there's no replacement for face-to-face relationship building, social media can give consumers the insight they need to connect with your business online. The key to successfully showing people the human side of your business is to offer unique insight.</p><h5 id=\"\">How can you do this?</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Share exclusive features about your business</li>\t<li id=\"\">Events in your local community</li>\t<li id=\"\">Behind the scenes pictures of your team</li>\t<li id=\"\">Stories about your “why” and what it means to customers</li>\t<li id=\"\">How you solve customer problems</li>\t<li id=\"\">What customers can expect from you and your company</li>\t<li id=\"\">Share your thoughts on trending topics within your industry</li>\t<li id=\"\">Sign your tweets or posts</li></ul><p><a href=\"http://socialmediaexaminer.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Social Media Examiner</a> uses that last tactic consistently.

Understand Your Audience Needs</h2><p>Whether you’re marketing to consumers or business professionals, share the details that matter most to them.From common everyday solutions to detailed instructions, take your knowledge and translate it into useable and valuable social media content.Want to know who your target market is and what they’re looking for? Use a tool like BuzzSumo to get inside their head.What are they talking about and what content is shared at a rapid pace? <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/\" id=\"\">Buzzsumo</a> will show you the most popular topics and content based on any given search.</p><h5 id=\"\">For example, you’re a pet trainer and want to see:</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">What your competition is talking about</li>\t<li id=\"\">What your potential clients are sharing</li></ul><p>Run a search based on “how to train my dog” and you now see the top search results based on social shares and relevance.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428222769d01c63ff092f81_buzzsumo.jpeg\" alt=\"buzzsumo analytics\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Create an Integrated Social Media Strategy</h2><p>Social media is not a one-off tactic. Ensure that each of your social properties is tied into your overall <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">marketing strategy</a>.This means that each spoke or social media channel serves a purpose, working together to support a long-term plan.</p><h5 id=\"\">How to Get Started</h5><p>Begin with a marketing calendar. From a high level, this will include all company events, activities, awards, special events and other yearly highlights.It will also include research that spells out your upcoming blog and social media content.From there you will detail how each of your social channels will syndicate your content. For example, how will Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram allow you to tap into previously untapped sectors?How often will you post and how will each social site tell your story and allow your online presence to grow?HubSpot's <a href=\"http://offers.hubspot.com/blog-editorial-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">free editorial calendar</a> is a great place to start building your marketing calendar!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221d2b8b8c40cb474145_blog-editorial-calendar.jpeg\" alt=\"blog editorial calendar\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">  </strong>5.

This means you share your content, other people’s content and then get involved in the conversation.<strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Be proactive, responsive and truly interested.</em></strong>It’s not enough to just be interesting.

Optimize Your Social Media Accounts</h2><p>Don’t overlook the power of social media optimization.Consumers often use keyword-based search queries when researching your product, service or niche.You can immediately increase visibility through the strategic use and placement of keywords within your social media accounts.This doesn’t mean keyword stuffing, but rather an organic and conversational way of letting customers know what you do.</p><h5 id=\"\">The Goal is To:</h5><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Optimize for human consumption</li>\t<li id=\"\">Optimize for SEO</li>\t<li id=\"\">Optimize for SMO</li>\t<li id=\"\">Optimize based on keywords</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>Building a powerful social media presence takes time and won't happen overnight.Tweaking your approach isn't enough.

Share Your Story</h2><p>There is magic in a well told story.It can captivate your audience, draw on emotion or act as a connector.A great story is the hook that instantly grabs the attention of any reader.</p><h5 id=\"\">Imagine this...</h5><p>How might a well told story humanize your business or brand? How could it create a relatable, conversational situation?And how could that conversation translate into better opportunities, deeper relationships and more meaningful client interactions?Recent research shows that stories create a major shift within the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-neuroscience-of-your-brain-on-fiction.html?adxnnl=1&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1354716276-vBCJNxgtIuIFGnU+PmkBpA&_r=1&\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">brain</a>. Readers who were only partially attentive, suddenly become terribly interested.This is due to the ability stories have to stimulate a specific part of the brain. They also have a special way of connecting business to consumer.Uri Hasson from Princeton explains how,</p><blockquote id=\"\">When we tell stories to others that have really helped us shape our thinking and way of life, we can have the same effect on them too. The brains of the person telling a story and listening to it can synchronize.</blockquote><p>This makes storytelling an incredibly powerful business tool.By sharing your story, you make a deeper connection with your reader. In fact, you can actually make them feel as if they were there, involved in your experience.</p><h5 id=\"\">Begin to build your story by answering a few questions:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What problems have you solved for past clients?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What was the success story(s) you can share?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How can you relate that story to a prospective client?</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822270480ca5127c3de3b_tell-your-story.jpeg\" alt=\"tell-your-story\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Know Your Audience</h2><p>Have you identified your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/effective-relationship-marketing/\" id=\"\">target market</a>? If not, you're more than likely speaking to the masses.Whether your target market is an individual or a business, it's important to understand what they're looking for and why they're interested in connecting with you.Remember: a vague message will fall on deaf ears.However, a message within a well crafted bio that's written with your ideal client in mind will always hit the mark.</p><h5 id=\"\">Determining Your Target Market</h5><p>It's important that you:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Be crystal clear in your description of each market you serve.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Be specific in the value you offer and the problems you solve.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Get inside the head of your consumer and know how they'll interact with your business.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Understand where they're spending their time and how to best position your skills given the social network.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822270480ca7bd0c3de3a_know-your-audience.jpeg\" alt=\"know-your-audience\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Fine-Tune Your Message</h2><p>Now that you have a better understanding into who your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/effective-relationship-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">target market</a> is and where they're spending their time, you're ready to fine-tune your message.Below is a <strong id=\"\">quick checklist</strong> to help you get started.</p><h5 id=\"\">Tips to Fine-Tune Your Message</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Each social network is designed to reach a unique market. Keep this in mind as your craft your social media bios. While LinkedIn might have a more professional focus, Twitter needs to stay short and punchy.</li> \t<li id=\"\">You only have so much time to capture the attention of your audience. Keep the most important details close to the top of your Google+, Facebook and LinkedIn bios.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Determine what your fans, followers and potential clients like, want and need. Speak directly to those needs by providing detailed case studies and examples of your work.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Know how you solve their problems and what you can offer that makes their situation better, easier or more affordable.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Remove any industry-speak or jargon and speak the language of your target market.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Update your skills, talents and strengths as they pertain to your industry and local market.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Include keywords that will be used by your target market. What are they typing in search when looking for your services?</li></ul><p><strong id=\"\">Remember:</strong> The details in your bio aren't just designed to relate a static message. Your bio should be relatable, credible, succinct and fluid.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822270480ca6460c3de39_fine-tune.jpeg\" alt=\"fine-tune\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"> 4. Be Unique</h2><p>Your bio is an opportunity to translate years of experience into a vibrant <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-to-virtually-crush-the-competition/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media profile</a>.To make meaningful connections, you must authentically represent your talents, skills and abilities.The key is to remain true to who you are and shine a light on what makes you a one-of-a-kind brand.</p><h5 id=\"\">HOW TO CREATE A MEMORABLE BIO:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Share your business story in a real and authentic way, allowing  prospective clients an intimate look in to who you are.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Answer the \"What's in it For Me\" question immediately.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create consistency from one social profile to the next.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create a bio that speaks directly to your fans and followers and then properly position it for each social network.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Be transparent in your intentions. Honesty creates trust and trust is at the foundation of any business relationship.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822270480ca35f1c3de3c_be-unique.jpeg\" alt=\"be-unique\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">5. Add Your Personality</h2><p>No one is all work and no play. Well, they might be, but it certainly doesn't make for an interesting bio or conversation.People want to get to know the real you. The you outside of your business that enjoys reading or playing tennis.Whatever it is, share it.Share your favorite anecdote or quote, and as we discussed above, tell a story that sheds light into the \"why\" behind your business.I call these fun little tidbits \"coffee table conversations.\"They are the connectors that allow people to instantly identify with who you are, creating commonality and shared interests.For example, I share my love of coffee and dogs in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RebekahRadice\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">my Twitter bio</a>. It allows fellow coffee and pet lovers access into conversations that matter to me.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Social Media, Digital Marketing Strategist, Author, Blogger, Keynote Speaker, Co-Founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Imagine_WOW\" id=\"\">@Imagine_WOW</a> | Coffee addict, sunshine lover &amp; nuts about my 2 pups! </blockquote><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822270480ca6622c3de37_2665.png\" alt=\"♥\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Below are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing.</p><h5 id=\"\">Ideas to Add Personality to Your Social Media Bio</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Add your hobbies (arts and crafts, beekeeping, painting).</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share a funny story.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Give insight into your childhood.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Talk about where you grew up.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Share your favorite restaurant or food.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use a word that is synonymous with you and explain why you favor using it.</li></ul><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822270480ca20e6c3de3d_share-your-personality.jpeg\" alt=\"share-your-personality\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  6. Be Brief</h2><p>In our hectic online world, many times, less is more.In fact, with an average attention span of <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/08/08/this-is-your-brain-on-visualization/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">8 seconds</a>, you only have a matter of moments to capture your reader's attention.If you find that your bio for any social network is becoming lengthy, edit it ruthlessly.What do I mean by this?Cut to the chase.Take me as an example. I'm a meat and potatoes kind of gal. I want to know who you are and cut through the fluff.Granted, a certain amount of fluff is important, but not always the most effective way to start out a bio.</p><h5 id=\"\">How to Write a Short Bio</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">List your top three strengths</li> \t<li id=\"\">List your top three skills</li> \t<li id=\"\">List your top three target markets</li> \t<li id=\"\">List your top three favorite pastimes or passions</li></ul><p>Now pretend this is an interview and you have to weave those details into a short narrative about who you are.Start with your name, add in what you do, be specific about who you serve and then fill in with a little color commentary on what you love to do in your spare time.Write it down and remember to keep your tone lively and upbeat.Voila! You've created a short, informative and unique bio.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822270480ca7000c3de38_be-brief.jpeg\" alt=\"be-brief\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h4 id=\"\">Need more inspiration?
