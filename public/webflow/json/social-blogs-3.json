      "wp-content": "<p>With four new iPhone 4s’ in my house, the last several days have been a non stop iPhone learning extravaganza.  As a recent Apple convert I have found an abundance of websites offering iPhone tips for newbies on everything from productivity tools to time sucking games ala <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8\" id=\"\">Angry Birds</a>.  The challenge for me has been taking in the \"shininess\" of my new toy and getting anything else accomplished!While the cool tools on the iPhone 4s continue to amaze me, Siri has definitely emerged as one of the best additions made by Apple.  In case you’re not familiar with Siri, this is Apple’s new voice control assistant that allows you to send messages, call friends, create reminders and schedule appointments all through voice command.While these tips may be a bit basic for former iPhone users, I hope newbies like myself will enjoy making the most of their new smart phone!</p><h3 id=\"\">Multitask</h3><p>True multitasking arrived with iOS 4, but it still seems a mystery to most iPhone users I’ve talked to.  Multitasking with the iPhone 4s is very simple and allows you to open multiple apps at once.Double click your Home button to view your open apps.  As your screen rolls up, the icons remaining in your task tray are open and running on your iPhone.  Slide through each and choose the apps you want to open.This means you are able to stream music from websites such as Pandora and control it in your task bar while navigating to other apps.**Additional Tip:  To close an open app, choose an app from your task tray and click and hold the app until they begin to jiggle.  You will now see a small minus sign in the upper left hand corner of the app.  Tap the sign to close out the app.  Click the Home button once to exit.</p><h3 id=\"\">Quickly Take a Screenshot of Your Phone</h3><p>Need to take a screenshot of the page you are currently viewing? It’s easy!  Quickly press and then release your home and sleep button simultaneously to snap a picture of your screen.  The image will not pop up but is now saved in your camera roll under Photos.  Once you’ve snapped the shot you can share it via email, use it as your wallpaper, tweet it out or save it for future reference.  If you work within a team like I do, this will be an invaluable tool to quickly send information without the time it might take to scan a pdf or document.And while we're talking about photos, another exciting change is that you can now take a picture from your lock screen.  Access your camera without entering your pass code or navigating to your camera.</p><h3 id=\"\">Clean Up Your Apps &amp; Create Folders</h3><p>For those of us on “app overload” creating folders is a huge help! Rather than scrolling through pages and pages of apps, you can drag and drop apps onto each other to create organized folders.To do this tap and hold the app and then drag it on top of another app. When you release the app a screen will pop up asking what you would like to name your folder.  You  can then continue to drag and drop similar apps into that folder making for a much cleaner screen to work within.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428220d07c9bb2c9f96d14b_Create-iPhone-4s-Folder.jpeg\" alt=\"Create iPhone 4s Folder\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Set Up Your Relationships with SIRI</h3><p>This was a fun little trick I discovered over the weekend.  Once you have imported your contacts you can identify your husband/wife, mom, dad, sister, brother and then quickly call or text each of them by asking Siri to contact them.  For example...I ask Siri to call my husband.  Siri tells me she is dialing Dean Radice.  It’s that simple and a great way to stay hands free while driving those buyers around in your car!Setting up your relationships is as easy as 1,2,3 with SIRI!</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Hold down your Home button to activate Siri</li> \t<li id=\"\">Tell Siri your relationship to your contact.  For example: “Dean is my husband” (you can also have a lot of fun in how you define or name your relationships...e.g \"sugar daddy\" as opposed to husband or \"blank check\" for my college son.  You get the idea.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Siri will automatically connect the relationship with that contact</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">Tap to get to the Top</h3><p>Do you find yourself scrolling through websites only to find now easy way to navigate back towards the top?  The good news is that no matter what website you have found yourself trapped in, tapping the status bar at the top of your screen will automatically bring you to the top of the page.Depending on how much time you plan on spending online, this is invaluable!And a last one just for fun...Ask Siri a QuestionMy last tip is purely for entertainment value.  Boys will be boys and mine have certainly spent their time researching fun questions to ask Siri.  Here are just a few for you to try out:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Who’s on first?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Will you marry me?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What do you think of Microsoft?</li></ul><p>For more fun with Siri, check out <a href=\"http://thingsthatsirisays.com/\" id=\"\">http://thingsthatsirisays.com/</a></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428220d07c9bb29e996d14c_Things-That-Siri-Says.jpeg\" alt=\"Things That Siri Says\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure>",

      "wp-content": "<p>We are living in the <strong id=\"\">social media</strong> age of instant gratification.  Everywhere we turn whether it’s Facebook, Google or our best friends blog; answers to our most pressing questions have never been more readily available.The Internet has become our go-to <strong id=\"\">resource for content</strong>, but wading through the social muck can be a challenge.  Creating your <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/6-time-saving-strategies-for-social-media-success/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">social media strategy</strong></a> and content cheat sheet can be a life saver.As a real estate or mortgage professional, being online is now a requirement and no longer a suggestion.  However, simply showing up online is not enough.Your <strong id=\"\">social media efforts</strong> require that you not only engage an already over stimulated society but increase your bottom line by providing fresh, relevant content.The problem with many marketers is the theory that you will simply build it and the fans will come. That's just not realistic within the online world.  It takes time, commitment and creativity to cultivate a community.Building a <strong id=\"\">content strategy</strong> and then creating a <strong id=\"\">content calendar</strong> is an excellent way to keep you focused on the needs of your subscribers, fans and followers rather than bouncing day to day without direction.</p><h1 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Social Media Content Strategy</strong></h1><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Multi Media</strong></h2><p>1. What niche or program can you spotlight?  Whether it is you on screen or a screencast of your latest PowerPoint, connecting with your audience through video is imperative.  A free program to create and share your screencast is <a href=\"http://www.screenr.com/\" id=\"\">Screenr</a>.  Just click “record now” and within seconds you are recording anything you can see on your screen.  Then choose where you want to share your video instantly. Choose from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and more!2. Record an interview with a vendor such as an appraiser, inspector or plumber and talk about homebuyer concerns, challenges, tips and quick fixes.  The amount of 60-90 second snippets you could create is endless!3. Create a video where you answer buyer and seller frequently asked questions.4. Discuss current events and explain what they mean to homebuyers and sellers.5. Choose locations in your area and pass along fun facts and trivia.  Pick a location to video yourself in front of and use it as a “Where’s Waldo” type of trivia question.  It should be fun and easy to identify.  This should generate a conversation between you and your Facebook fans and Twitter followers.6. Record testimonials from your clients and post to your blog as well as your email marketing campaigns as a way to boost credibility.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Step-by-Step Guides:</strong></h2><p>1. Walk buyers through the 10 Mistakes Homebuyers Must Avoid or sellers through the Steps to Selling Your Home in a Down Market.  Turn your article into a pdf and offer as an opt-in incentive on your website. 2. Take frequently asked questions and offer an instructional guide3. Turn the home buying process into a step-by-step instructional.  Not only do you allow clients to connect with you online and get a sense of how you will handle their transaction, but it's a great way to keep them informed by sending the video via email throughout the process.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How-to’s and Tip’s</strong></h2><p>1. Offer insight into the home buying process and your expertise on what a buyer can expect.   What common issues do buyers and sellers face throughout the process?  What problems/challenges can you offer tips or how-to's on?2. Explain what the benefits are about:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Homeownership</li> \t<li id=\"\">Investment Properties</li> \t<li id=\"\">2<sup id=\"\">nd</sup> Homes</li> \t<li id=\"\">Staging Your Home</li> \t<li id=\"\">Specialty programs such as the FHA 203k</li></ul><p>3. Offer Weekly Tips or Tricks via video postcards.  A free online tool I have used many times is <a href=\"http://www.movavi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Movav</a>i.  It's easy to use and the price is right!4. Share slides from a recent presentation on <a href=\"http\" id=\"\">slideshare</a> and then copy and paste into a blog post.5. Share thoughts, takeaways and your most important clips from conferences, seminars, educational trainings etc. through slideshows, screencasts and slideshare.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Blog &amp; Social Media Content</strong></h2><p>1. Discuss highlights and share insights from recent industry events you have attended.  It's a great opportunity to give clients a behind the scenes look at the industry and offer your feedback on what you learned or felt were the key takeaways.2. Promote your videos by syndicating to 25 video sites at once through <a href=\"http://www.tubemogul.com\" id=\"\">TubeMogul</a> and then track your results through their detailed analytics dashboard.3. Create weekly webinars related to buyer and seller FAQ, what buyers can expect throughout a typical transaction, how to navigate the home buying process or how to get their loan approved the first time.  There are an endless amount of tutorials you could produce!4. Revive past content by reposting videos, articles and trainings to Facebook, Twitter and Social Bookmarking sites.  If you are a Wordpress user, a great way to revive old blog posts is through Tweet Old Post.5. Ask via your social networks what the needs of your audience are and do this consistently.  It’s an easy way to stay topical and on target with the information your fans and followers are hungry for.  Then take this information and write a blog Q&amp;A that responds to their questions or concerns.6. Explain what a current event or topic means to our audience by either offering a unique perspective or offering the who, what, why and how behind the topic including the impact it will or could have on the industry.7. Take common RE or mortgage myths and offer facts surrounding common misunderstood topics8. Promote company news including changes, events, updates, promotions, new hires, etc to allow the community to feel connected to the brand9. Survey your community through Survey Monkey or a Twtpoll about real estate questions. Top concerns, market myths and common misconceptions within the process and then use this information through an informational video or blog post.  Share information in a way that solves a challenge, fulfills a need or offers support.10. Share pictures as often as possible.  If there is an event or conference you attend, post the pictures to your social sites and write a blog about it.  You want your audience to become interested and engaged in who you are and where you are at all times.11. Ask hypothetical questions or tell a story to identify buyer or seller needs and assist them in connecting with who you are and what your role is throughout the process.One last thought I will offer is the importance of tracking your efforts and consistently evaluating the effectiveness of your message through <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/social-media-analytics-4-tools-you-may-have-been-missing-87345\" id=\"\">social monitoring tools</a> such as SocialBro, Hootsuite, Twitter Counter and Crowd Booster.What would you add to this list?</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>If you have wondered what Foursquare is or why you would use it in your business, you’re not alone.  Many Real Estate agents I talk to haven’t even set up a personal account let alone given it a second look when it comes to marketing their business.  What they’re missing is the key component behind Foursquare’s marketing power.  As a Real Estate agent, Foursquare is another FREE social network that allows you to <a href=\"http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/07/06/over-500000-businesses-are-on-foursquare-thats-a-lot-of-specials/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">market your services and your listings</a>.If you’re not familiar with Foursquare, it’s a location based social network that allows users to \"check-in\" at their favorite stores, restaurants, coffee shops or any venue they visit.

The real power for real estate agents is the ability to offer easy access to your listings, track prospective clients wants and needs and offer incentives to gain new customers.Set Up Your FREE Foursquare AccountYour first step is signing up for your personal account.

      "wp-content": "<p>Twitter has been an incredible marketing tool within my business.  In fact, a little known secret is my affinity towards <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/should-you-be-using-twitter-in-your-business/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Twitter</a> over any other social media platform.  Believe it or not, I was one of those Facebook hold-outs a few years back.  I just couldn’t see the value in reading about what someone had for breakfast or that your sister’s, brother-in-law’s best friend is cheating on his wife.  Twitter on the other hand has been a goldmine within my business.When I first dove into social media, I enjoyed Twitter’s “texting to the masses” ability and the level of engagement I found in tweeting, re-tweeting, messaging and following.  I have built countless relationships on Twitter and not only have I created valuable business contacts through many people that I follow, but I’ve been hired by many that follow me.  Because of this, I always find it interesting that in our “text crazy” world so many people just can’t seem to wrap their brain around the importance Twitter plays in our overall social media strategy.So how can you <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/twitter-for-business-the-who-the-why-and-the-how/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">use Twitter to market your business</a>?  Let’s take a look at 3 simple strategies that can get you started today!Connect with Potential ClientsSimilar to Facebook, Twitter gives us the ability to connect with potential clients in a far more intimate way than traditional media.  Twitter allows potential customers to get a better understanding of who you are, what your business is all about and how you might best serve their needs given their particular circumstance.  The days of hiring someone without any prior knowledge as to how they run their business is over.  Today all anyone needs to do is Google you.  Twitter is one more way for those potential clients to find the information they are looking for by connecting with you.Start by researching and following people with similar interests.  Two great sites are <a href=\"http://wefollow.com/\" id=\"\">WeFollow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.twellow.com/\" id=\"\">Twellow</a>.  Both give you the ability to define your niche, part of the country and even your specific city through <a href=\"http://www.twellow.com/twellowhood\" id=\"\">Twellowhood</a>.Build Your Database ListI’ve heard it said many times that it’s not the salesperson with the most friends that wins; it’s the one with the largest database that will succeed time and time again.  Building a list of potential customers is your opportunity to market to a select group of individuals and cater to their exact needs.  Twitter gives you 140 characters to grab your follower’s attention and invite them to check out your free offer, newsletter, market update or any other material someone following you would find tantalizing enough to click on.Don’t be shy about putting yourself out there!  Potential clients want the information and knowledge you have so share it with them.  Ask yourself on a daily basis what you can give away that will keep them coming back for more.  Tips about buying their first home, tips on how to sell their home in a down market, tips on how to stage their home…the list of ideas is endless!Increase Website TrafficIncreasing website traffic works hand in hand with building your database.  Two strategies to use to increase website visibility:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Connect your blog to Twitter and automatically notify your followers each time you post a new article.  An easy way to do this is to grab your RSS feed (example: rebekahradice.com/feed) and create a free account with <a href=\"http://twitterfeed.com/\" id=\"\">Twitterfeed</a>.  Once you set up a feed, your new post will tweet out immediately without you lifting a finger. If you use Wordpress, a great plugin that auto tweets your post is <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tweet-this/\" id=\"\">TweetThis</a>.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create an opt-in form on your website.  Attract attention through your Tweets by offering a free report .  If you use Wordpress and work with a system like AWeber it’s as easy as creating your web form and grabbing the html code.  Once you’ve done that, you can add it to your Wordpress site through the text widget.</li></ul>",

Post Consistently</h2><p id=\"\">I don’t know about you, but if I visit a blog that hasn’t been updated in weeks or even months, I don’t consider them a viable resource. &nbsp;Posting consistently lends credibility to your blog. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Plan on <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/5-tips-to-writing-a-great-blog-post/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">writing two great, content rich posts</strong></a> per week. &nbsp;Then pick the days and times you will post so your readers become accustomed to looking for you.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">2. Provide Valuable Information and Resources</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Answer questions, provide tips and offer items of value that are relevant to your readership. &nbsp;Listen to your readers and find ways to solve problems, establishing you as their go-to authority within your market. &nbsp;Building trust will not happen overnight. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Giving freely of your insight, wisdom and knowledge will allow readers to see you are in it for them, not just the paycheck.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3. Speak Directly to Your Target Market</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Do not assume you know what the needs of your readers are. &nbsp;All you can assume is that your readers have an <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/the-riches-in-your-niches-how-to-define-conquer-your-niche\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">interest in your niche</strong></a>.</p><p id=\"\">Ask questions, listen to the answers and study your analytics. &nbsp;It’s very easy to see through Google Analytics where your readers came from, what keywords they used to end up on your page and how long they are staying on your site. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This is precisely why it is vital to speak directly to the needs of your readers and adjust that message to encourage readership growth.</p><h2 id=\"\">4.

Join in the Conversation</h2><p id=\"\">The single most effective way to build loyalty and trust is through conversation. &nbsp;A blog allows readers to get to know you on a very intimate level. If you let comments sit without responding or even acknowledging them, you are giving away a valuable opportunity. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You not only have the chance to answer their question in a public forum but you allow your readers to see that you care about their needs and are there to assist when they are ready.</p>",

Building credibility and establishing a readership base is one of the biggest hurdles bloggers face.  Guest blogging allows you to benefit from an established blog by putting you in front of a much larger audience.When I first entertained writing guest posts, my questions were – why would I guest blog and what’s in it for me?  In other words, why would I blog anywhere other than my own blog and why would I pass along content I’d worked so hard on?My concern was this:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">I would be pushing people towards a blog I didn’t own</li> \t<li id=\"\">I therefore would have no control over that blog</li></ul><p>In my experience, both concerns were unfounded and the results I received were well worth the additional blogging effort.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Why Guest Blog</strong></h2><p>Guest blogging gives you the chance to seek out well established authority blogs that can increase the awareness and visibility of your online presence.Chances are an authority blog that has been around for a good amount of time has an established and loyal readership.  Your job as a guest blogger is to offer inspiring and enlightening content that connects with their current readers.With quality content, guest blogging can enhance your credibility and drive readers to your own blog where they can find content similar to their interests. The goal is to acquire readership and traffic that might not have found you otherwise.Other benefits an authority blog can offer:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">An increase in your notoriety and reputation within your given area of expertise</li> \t<li id=\"\">Buzz that goes viral when your post is tweeted and shared</li> \t<li id=\"\">Readers that are already interested in your niche</li> \t<li id=\"\">Targeted, value-rich inbound links that make Google take notice</li> \t<li id=\"\">Improved search engine ranking</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Before You Start Guest Blogging</strong></h2><p>The biggest mistake bloggers can make is requesting a guest blog spot before building a solid base of quality content.  It is essential that you have at least a few articles on your own blog first before you try pushing people towards it.If you have a passion for your niche and are able to connect with your current reader base, more than likely that will translate to posts written on a blog with similar interests.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Get Started</strong></h2><p>Your first step is determining what value you will bring as a guest blogger. Then do your homework.  Who are the leading or authority blogs within your niche?  Is their content in line with yours?Your next step is to reach out to the blog owner.  A simple email requesting a guest spot with links to your content is all that’s needed.  Make sure you express why you are interested and what you currently write about.  The worst they can is no and you move on.  My odds are on the fact that they will say yes if you're doing your job well and consistently.Guest blogging can be your ticket to heightened online awareness, improved readership and increased blog traffic!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Updated January, 2019Are you looking to start a blog? Wondering how to blog for your business? Before you get started, you first need to discover your blog purpose.That purpose becomes your focus. It creates a rhythm and a flow to your content that allows your initial readers to relate. You share your thoughts in a way that naturally attracts the exact right reader.So how do you figure out the purpose of your blog? Below are the first 6 steps you must take to create a blog and discover its purpose.</p><h1 id=\"\">Starting a Blog? Here's How to Discover Your Blog Purpose</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Find Your Blog Purpose</h2><p>According to Webster’s, purpose is:</p><blockquote id=\"\">Intentionally or deliberately working towards an aim or a goal.</blockquote><p>Purposeful blogging based on conviction gives you motivation. Blogging without purpose can leave both you and your readers feeling frustrated and lost.When I <a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/start-a-successful-blog-in-7-easy-steps/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">first started blogging</a>, I struggled to find my purpose.  I was a random blogger without consistency.  I also lacked content that served anyone in particular.Looking back today, I wonder how those 400 word posts even gained traction. But hey, it was a different time in the blogging world with very different expectations.</p><h5 id=\"\">Today, if you want to blog with success, you need to identify:</h5><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">How a blog will support your current business mission, vision, values</li> \t<li id=\"\">How a blog will support the growth of your new business idea</li> \t<li id=\"\">What the competitive landscape looks like and how you're filling a unique need</li> \t<li id=\"\">Why your audience will (and should) care about your blog and ultimately... your business</li></ol><p>If you're spinning out in trepidation and fear, worried that if you \"niche\" down and get specific you'll lose a broader audience, don't worry.It's only when I narrowed my focus that things began to turn around. Once I stopped claiming my audience as \"everyone\" and decided to speak to an \"<a href=\"http://rebekahradice.com/writing-best-blog-post/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">audience of one</a>,\" my blog began to grow.I moved from obscure blogger to Award winning writer, a blog that eclipsed 250,000 Pageviews per month, and an email list that grew from 5,000 to 25,000 in less than 6 months.And that's exactly what finding your purpose can mean to your blog and your business.</p><h2 id=\"\">   2. Create A Vision Fоr Yоur Blog</h2><p>Once уоu knоw whу уоu wаnt tо blog, the next step is creating a vision that will power your blog. Think about the message you want  tо relay tо your readers.For example, if you're a health and fitness instructor, do you want to show people how they can eat healthy and lose weight? If so, your vision will include content that leads them through your process.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FJSHealth%2Fvideos%2F1041963206447458%2F&show_text=false&width=267&t=0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></figure><p>You might show them how their eating habits impact their health or share your strategy to get out of bed and make it to the gym consistently.Whatever the case, write with your reader in mind. What do they want to know, learn from you, and gain when they subscribe to your blog?Let that power your vision!</p><h2 id=\"\"> 3. Commit to Your Blog Purpose</h2><p>I didn't immediately find meaning in my writing. I blogged about things I knew, but didn’t put my heart into it.My articles felt lifeless and my readership numbers reflected that. I needed a strategy. The problem was that there was no way I could define a strategy without purpose.I was sporadic and un-focused in my blogging and my words lacked conviction. I needed a “blog intervention” and fast!While my intervention was slow to come, the questions I asked myself will be beneficial to you, no matter the stage you're in.</p><h5 id=\"\">How to Create a Sustainable Blog</h5><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What do you want to achieve with your blog? (specific results)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Who are you most passionate in serving? (your ideal audience)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Why will this be a long-term commitment for you? (what will keep you going on the tough days)</li></ol><h5 id=\"\">To give you an example, my answers would look like this:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Authority: create content around a singular focus or topic</li> \t<li id=\"\">Credibility: build a reputation within in your industry</li> \t<li id=\"\">Thought Leadership: drive market decisions by anticipating needs</li> \t<li id=\"\">Motivational: excite, inspire, and lead your audience</li> \t<li id=\"\">Legacy: design content that leaves an indelible mark on your industry, audience, and community</li></ul><p>Barkabull Animal Rescue does exactly that. They create content that increases awareness around a cause, inspires action and encourages empathy.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.75%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"33.75%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"0:0\" data-page-url=\"\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbarkabull%2Fposts%2F496456870758234&width=500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  4. Infuse Your Passion</h2><p>If you're blogging to create authority and credibility (and I'm sure you are), then you know you must eat, sleep and breathe your subject matter. Consistently blogging about your topic creates a conversation around your brand, but it will take time.But knowing your topic doesn’t always equal passion. Are you passionate about what you're blogging about? If not, it may not come as natural as breathing to you. If your content feels forced, your readers will sense that.And if you're not excited about your blog, then who on earth can be?</p><h5 id=\"\">Take out a notepad and pen and write:</h5><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">The first 10 topics that you're most interested in</li> \t<li id=\"\">The top 3-5 topics you're an expert in</li></ul><p>Now ask yourself, are these topics you could write about even if you didn't get paid? (not your goal, but you catch my drift)If your answer is yes and they're not a part of your blog now, get them added in. This will add rotation and increase credibility in a variety of areas.Instead of being a one trick pony, you show that your interests are diverse, but your solutions specific and unique.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Create a Conversation</h2><p>Do you work daily to engage your readers, draw on their emotions, and ask them to discuss, debate and contact you?Are you asking open ended questions or using free offers or advice to draw them in?Have you defined a call to action and do you ask them to take action on a consistent basis?If you can’t create a conversation then you will never gain a audience that feels a part of your community.  Make it feel like home to them…a place where they belong and enjoy spending time.You also want to create a feeling of loss if they miss an article.How can you drive readers to your blog and then interact with them on a daily basis?  i.e. blogging about hot topics, local information, answering frequently asked questions.Be specific and then take action by adding this to your blog.</p><h2 id=\"\"> 6. Write Relevant Content</h2><p>By engaging your readers on a consistent basis you should be totally in sync with their needs.  Listen to their concerns, their fears about the market, what keeps them awake at night and craft your content around this.Your articles should be a refuge, an answer and a calming force in an otherwise tumultuous and overwhelming time within their lives.Give them what they are searching for and they will be forever grateful.</p><h2 id=\"\">  Final Thoughts</h2><p>Whether you're a business owner or an entrepreneur, your blog plays a vital role in your success. Not only does it increase visibility, but also improves engagement as you build a loyal following.Turn your blog into the catalyst that drives you toward your goals.  Identify your purpose and then write with conviction.Getting clear on your purpose will open up the creative flood gates and allow you to connect with your audience all while building your brand and your profitability.</p>",

In order to generate buzz and gain traction, you will need to boost your blog’s online visibility.   It’s essential that you have a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/6-time-saving-strategies-for-social-media-success/\" id=\"\">social media strategy</a> as well as a consistent posting schedule and plan.To achieve this, a crucial element to increased blog traffic is your content.  This is the driving force behind your blog’s success as it’s what keeps readers coming back time and time again.  It’s definitely not an area where you can take a “hit or miss” approach.Here are 7 quick and easy tips to get you on the road to blog readability and sustainability!Pick One Topic and Stick With ItDefine what your one topic will be per post and stick with it. If you feel yourself getting off track or going off on a tangent then take the time to slowly work your way back through the post.  Can you take this tangent and break it up into a series of posts?  Don’t just automatically delete and move on.  I find that “getting off track” in my current article can offer additional talking points and ideas for additional blogs.Choose Your Words WiselyClean up your post and eliminate all of your unnecessary or \"weakening\" words and/or phrases. (Adjectives and adverbs are typically the first ones to cut!)Remember that keyword density (the percentage of keywords used based on the number of words in your post) is a very important part of organic SEO. Optimizing your blog posts is one part of the writing process and a big step toward increasing traffic to your website or blog.Post ConsistentlyThere's no getting around this one.  Don’t try to make each post a work of art or a 1000 word article.  Just get out there and write and realize that sometimes good is good enough.  By consistently posting, increased traffic will begin to happen as readers refer and search engines find you.  With a little effort, your blog can and will change your business.Write Catchy Blog Post TitlesWrite short, effective headlines for blog posts. Start with your main keyword and then work it into your title and post.  The challenge can be making it feel natural.Make sure that your post titles:</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Stimulate the curiosity of your readers and</li>\t<li id=\"\">Summon their emotions – whether it’s anger, frustration, happiness or excitement</li></ul><p>Check the Readability of Your Blog Before PostingReading your post out loud allows you to feel what your reader will feel as they read through it.  It also allows you to sense where you can edit or eliminate unnecessary verbiage. I always read my articles out loud (to the utter frustration of my family) to hear the flow of each sentence and make certain it isn't too wordy or choppy.  There’s no shame in editing as you read through.  Practice makes perfect!Apply the Rule of OneApply one of these rules to each of your posts:</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Offer a solution for your readers</li>\t<li id=\"\">Offer an answer that your competition isn’t</li>\t<li id=\"\">Show “how-to” do something</li>\t<li id=\"\">Encourage your readers through facts to make a decision</li>\t<li id=\"\">Entertain your readers through a relatable story</li>\t<li id=\"\">Inspire your readers through “feel good” stories</li>\t<li id=\"\">Make your readers laugh, cry or think</li>\t<li id=\"\">Let your readers get to know you and understand that you really can make a difference in their life or situation</li></ul><p>Now ask yourself:  How does this article make the lives of my readers better or easier?Mix Up Your PostsIntersperse fun, relatable stories with educational and informative articles all while making it entertaining and engaging.You don’t need to do a hard sell to get people to buy from you.  What you need is authentic, relevant information that offers insight into who you are and why they need to take action with you today.Writing great blog content only requires a couple things – consistent posts from someone that truly cares.Generating blog traffic will come as you make blogging a part of your routine.  Good luck -- and here's to increased blog traffic!Here are a few more resources on writing effective blog posts and generating blog traffic.<a href=\"http://activerain.com/blogsview/2385581/how-to-write-a-catchy-blog-post-title-that-pops\" id=\"\">How to Write a Catchy Blog Post Title that POPS</a><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/blogging-mistakes-you-cant-afford-to-make/\" id=\"\">Blogging Mistakes You Can’t Afford to Make</a><a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/20-sure-fire-blog-titles-that-get-results/\" id=\"\">20 Sure-Fire Blog Titles that Get Results</a></p>",

It has impacted every aspect of our lives, including the time we waste monitoring it.So how can we effectively build our online presence while reducing the wasteful time we spend tweeting, posting, and updating our various social sites?Creating a social media strategy and setting up a distribution plan will help you steer clear of the many “time sucks” like distracting games, gossip and other non-money making endeavors.Sure there’s a time and place to play games, but it's not while you're working. Granted, you may not have a boss looking over your shoulder, but that doesn’t give you a hall pass to allow non-productive habits.</p><h1 id=\"\">6 Time Saving Strategies for Social Media Success</h1><h2 id=\"\">Map Your Destination</h2><p>If you have yet to sit down and map out your social media destination, you are not likely to succeed. Of course, there are always the lucky ones who somehow manage to hit the lottery after they have only purchased one ticket.But for most of us, success comes from careful and thoughtful planning. Don't set out recklessly with a hit-or-miss strategy. Instead, create a plan and stick to it, adjusting as needed.</p><h2 id=\"\">Know Your Audience</h2><p>Social Media offers us the unique ability to throw our marketing net out further than ever before.  We are able to get our message in front of a much larger audience, but with that come accountability and responsibility.We are responsible for monitoring our time and holding ourselves accountable to our goals.  It’s easy to lose sight of who our audience is or what our online purpose is.  Before you dive into social media, map your destination and know who your target audience is.</p><h2 id=\"\">Create a Distribution Plan</h2><p>I’m often asked what my blogging philosophy is regarding content distribution.  With so many blogging platforms to choose from: WordPress, Active Rain, Posterous, Real Estate Marbles, Tumblr, and Blogger, it’s a difficult decision to determine where your post should originate.The most important piece is to start with the blogging platform you are comfortable with before creating your social media strategy.  ALL of your original content should begin on your blog and push out to other social media sites.</p><h2 id=\"\">Use Automation Tools</h2><p>Automating a few of your social media posts is another great time saver. There are quite a few tools to choose from that allow you to schedule your posts.Plus, some tools can post to multiple sites all at once. This time-saving tool will free up your time so you can spend it interacting and conversing with potential clients rather than just pushing information out to them.Automation Options:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" id=\"\">Hootsuite</a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.tweetdeck.com/\" id=\"\">Tweetdeck</a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://socialoomph.com/\" id=\"\">Social Oomph</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Outsource Tasks (not the Conversation!)</h2><p>Yes, it is possible to outsource certain elements of social media. A <a href=\"http://www.undergroundmarketingsociety.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">virtual assistant</a> can arrange all your automation. They can also keep track of your metrics, and alert you to important tweets or buzz that you need to address in a blog post or in a direct message to someone.A good long-term virtual assistant can even answer your direct messages for you when needed.  Outsourcing isn’t for everyone, but it is a solution for someone that just doesn’t enjoy working with social media on a daily basis.</p><h2 id=\"\">Shut It Down</h2><p>Yep, you read that right. When you're done with work, you should be done with social media for your business. There isn’t any reason to tweet, respond to Facebook posts or comment on blogs 24/7.It will only serve to distract you from money making tasks and keep you from enjoying other important aspects of your life. There are better and more effective ways to monitor social media and at some point, you need a life outside social media.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>With proper planning, implementation and perseverance your social media efforts can and will pay off.You can build your presence, drive more traffic to your website and blog, write more business and see success you never thought possible.</p>",

But where do you start, what do you say, and how do you <strong id=\"\">promote your page </strong>and your audience?Here's how to market and grow your business on Facebook, starting today!</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Market and Grow Your Business on Facebook</h1><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Things You Need to Know Before Getting Started</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Your <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Facebook business page</strong></a> will be attached to your personal page.  In other words, you cannot create a page until you have set up a personal Facebook account.  Once you’ve done that, you can create an unlimited number of <strong id=\"\">Facebook pages</strong>.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your Facebook page is also public, so fans can easily find your business and Google.  Your page and posts are indexed, giving it the beloved “Google Juice” we’re all looking for.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Facebook is designed to get you and your brand in front of as many eyeballs as possible.  The problem with most businesses is that they jump in without a plan.</li> \t<li id=\"\">It may be exciting to hop on the Facebook bandwagon but without clearly defined goals and a system to track your progress; your enthusiasm may quickly fizzle. Your goal should be to create an engaging page that gives your fans a reason to seek you out daily.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Create a Page</strong></h2><p>Your first step is to generate your new page.  To begin the design of your new <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Facebook Page</strong></a>, you will need to add a <strong id=\"\">business page</strong> to your current profile.I’m not going to dive into the step-by-step instructions, but you can find them under <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/learn.php\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Facebook Page guidelines</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">2. Create a Custom Welcome Page</strong></h2><p>Facebook allows you to create a <strong id=\"\">custom page</strong> or <strong id=\"\">mini website</strong> within your Facebook Page.  You can then direct all new fans to this page where you can promote your business, give away a freebie, host a contest, or request that they sign up for your free newsletter.  This is one area you need to get your creative juices flowing and determine what “item of value” will draw fans in and get them to click the LIKE button.Video is always a BIG draw.  Check out the great job my friends Frank and Brian at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/frankandbrian\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Think Big Work Small</strong></a> have done with their <strong id=\"\">Facebook Welcome Tab</strong>.<strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Important Side Note</em></strong>:  Since Facebook discontinued its support of fbml (Facebook’s answer to html), building an <strong id=\"\">iframe site</strong> can be a little tricky.  But don’t worry; there are simple ways to get your page up and running in a jiffy.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Design a FREE Facebook Landing Page</strong></h2><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">If you have admin rights to your Wordpress blog, you can add the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/facebook-tab-manager/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Facebook Tab Manager</strong></a> plugin which allows you to edit and customize your page within your Wordpress blog.</li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.wix.com/flash_websites/facebook-fan-page-fish2?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=bi_FPA%5ecustomize&experiment_id=Customize%20%2Bfacebook%20page&gclid=CPKiyOqf0akCFRxrgwodRW_jMA\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Wix Facebook Page</strong></a><strong id=\"\"> </strong></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://new.pagemodo.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Pagemodo</strong></a></li> \t<li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://iframes.wildfireapp.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Wildfire Facebook IFrame App</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3. Add Content <em id=\"\">Before</em> You Promote Your Page</strong></h2><p>This idea is based on the theory that it is better to offer an enormous amount of value and build loyalty within your fans long before you ask for their business.Make sure you have several posts up before making your page public.  Not sure where to find content?  Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Blogs/Articles You Have Written (you probably have hundreds to rotate through)</li> \t<li id=\"\">News Resources (local and national newspapers with tips, tools and how-to’s for buyers and sellers)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Announce a Sales Event or Promotion</li> \t<li id=\"\">Give Away a FREE E-Book or other item of value</li> \t<li id=\"\">Offer how-to advice that save buyers and sellers time and money</li> \t<li id=\"\">Talk about local events</li> \t<li id=\"\">Spotlight a local vendor and offer a coupon that they must opt in for on your website</li> \t<li id=\"\">Create Top 10 Lists and break them out into daily posts</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pick an obvious local location to film a video from and invite fans to find you.  The first person to comment with your correct location wins a prize.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4. Add Consistent Content </strong></h2><p>Just like your blog, your Facebook fan page will quickly become obsolete if you’re not constantly offering fresh content.  I suggest posting at least once per day and at the high traffic times when your information is most likely to come up on your fans wall.According to a recent study by <a href=\"http://buddymedia.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Buddy Media</strong></a>, there are not only certain days that are optimal but times of the day as well.  Interestingly enough, their findings concluded that 60% of businesses were posting during normal business hours but those that posted outside of those hours had a <strong id=\"\">20% higher engagement rate</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5. Add the LIKE Button &amp; Box to Your Blog </strong></h2><p>Allow blog followers and website visitors to find your page by adding the Like <a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">button</strong></a> or <a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">box</strong></a><strong id=\"\"> </strong>to your site.Begin by creating your <a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Like Box</strong></a> by adding your Facebook page URL to the plugin.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428220562519382e140336c_Facebook-Like-Box-300x238.png\" alt=\"Facebook Like Box\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">6. Find Fans</strong></h2><p>A big misconception is that once you’ve set up your <strong id=\"\">Facebook business page</strong> you should immediately start inviting all of your family and friends.  This is a no-no and I’ll tell you why.First, why invite a large group of people with no true interest in your page?  Your page is about generating business, and involving a static group of people brings no intrinsic value.  Secondly, how many invites do you have waiting for you right now that you have yet to read?  We’ve all become accustomed to the invite “noise,” but spamming your friends is intrusive and just poor manners.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Here are a few creative ways to find new fans:</strong></h4><ul id=\"\"> \t<li> \tVisit Facebook pages where home buyers hang out. Spend time engaging with that community and bring awareness to your page. \t</li><li id=\"\">Add your Facebook page to all of your direct marketing along with an incentive to LIKE your page.</li><li> \t</li><li id=\"\">Add to your Email Signature</li></ul><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Create Facebook Ads – Ads allow you to go hyper-local giving you the most targeted bang for your marketing buck.  For a very small budget, you can use ads to get your message in front of the exact person you want fanning your page.  Start creating your <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/advertising/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Facebook ad</strong></a> and have it up and running in no time.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Host an Event online or offline and drive fans back to your Facebook fan page.  Once you’ve hosted the event, make sure some pictures can be uploaded and tagged.  Encourage your fans to tag themselves in the photos.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Invite fans to join through an <strong id=\"\">SMS Text Message</strong>.  Your fans will simply send a text message to 32665 (FBOOK) with the words “fan yourusername” in the message.  Your page will need a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/username/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">unique username</strong></a> before you can use this feature.  You must have 25 fans before you are able to choose a username.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">7. Send a Thank You Message</strong></h2><p>A \"Thank You\" message might be the most unappreciated but powerful business tool ever created. Just as we send a quick handwritten note to thank someone for their kindness, doing the same on Facebook extends that level of gratitude.Your message is short and sweet with two purposes.  You thank them for <strong id=\"\">becoming fans of your page</strong> and pointing out a specific item of value or important information you want them to be aware of.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">I’d love to hear your ideas and see what works for you!  Comment below with a link to your Facebook page so we can check it out and “LIKE” your page!</strong></h4>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Are you making these common Facebook mistakes?Sure, we've all stumbled at some point. It's part of the learning process while building and implementing our Fanpage marketing plan.Then there are a few not-so-common ones that will bite you in the butt, causing many to hightail it out of this fantastic social platform.Below is a list of a few DON'Ts when building your brand and attempting to grow your following:</p><h1 id=\"\">5 Facebook Mistakes Killing Your Page</h1><ul id=\"\"> \t<li>Not Responding to Comments</li></ul><p>Similar to blogging, social media platforms require your involvement.  If you have a Facebook page but rarely respond to your fans, you will quickly drive a wedge between you and them.Have you wondered why your following is stagnant or has shrunk?  Look no further than your consistency in managing your page.  Your Facebook Page is there to present you in your best light:  It’s up to you to live up to the picture you’ve created.If you meet your fans with dead silence, what are they to think?  Even if you just hit the “Like” button after a reader’s thoughtful or eager comment is enough to flatter and acknowledge them.  You’ve now recognized their comment making them feel “heard.”</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li>Taking Your Anger Out on the Page</li></ul><p>Lose your temper or patience once with a fan or blast someone on your wall and even the best-looking page in the world won’t save your image.  People will look at your flawlessly created Facebook Page afterwards and conclude:  “You’re a big phony!”This isn’t to say that you can’t express frustration or unhappiness about an industry update or news article, but it should always be done to share, warn or inform rather than venting.  Your ranting might appeal to some, but not for long.  Think about those people that frequently explode or spend their days whining about how unfair life is.  How does it make you feel?  It makes you want to run for the door, right?!Keep your tone true to your page and don’t make your fans want to run for the “dislike” button.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li>Bad-Mouthing Your Competition</li></ul><p>It’s one thing to share your success stories with your fans; it’s another to rub it in the face of your competition.  For example, let’s say you bring home the Top Producer award for your company. It’s exciting news to share with your followers and something they will enjoy celebrating with you.  Where you cross the line is to say “I was up against agent x in my office and he doesn’t hold a candle to me.  Everyone can see he’s a poor imitation.”Reducing someone else in the eyes of others only to raise yourself up leaves you looking shallow and self-absorbed.  Not exactly the image you should be hoping to portray.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li>Posting to Your Page and Forgetting to Monitor Response</li></ul><p>Having a page and forgetting to “work the room” is a huge mistake made by many new Facebook Fan Page Admins.  You schedule your daily post and then move on to the rest of your day failing to return and respond.Just like mistake #1, not monitoring your page is similar to ignoring the analytics of your page.  You can build your fan page and sure, you might even gain a few followers but if you neglect the needs of your fans your page will quickly lose steam and fall into the great Facebook abyss.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li>Spamming the Feed and Friends</li></ul><p>I’ve talked about this in previous articles and the abusive nature in which many Fan Page Admins wield that “suggest to friends” button.You may have made an initial good impression, but again, that will quickly evaporate if you spam your readers with endless emails or Text Messages.  However, a little-realized fact about this is that people who spam often don’t realize their followers are perceiving it as such.What’s really wrong that gives off this false perception is not your relentless drive to force people to buy… but a lack of planning and scheduling.Scheduled posts and announcements about your Facebook Page offers or changes won’t feel like “too much” of a good thing.  People will have subliminally adjusted to the “rhythm” of your regular posts.Building your brands online presence will not mysteriously happen if you haven’t committed to “showing up” on a daily basis.It’s to your benefit to choose who you want to be known as and then represent that person through your online presence each and every day.  The important part is to identify your follower’s needs and then satisfy it.The goal is to spend less time trying to figure out Facebook and more time attracting exactly the fans you are looking for!Here’s to your expanded Facebook following!</p>",

But that would be misleading.Social media is so much more than that for me, and it can be for your business too.But here’s a simple fact - the majority of businesses on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are wasting their time.  Why?  They don’t use social media effectively to <strong id=\"\">leverage their brand</strong>.We all know social media impacts what we read, what we buy, what movies we see and even the way we view our favorite brands.In fact, a recent survey shows that we’ve become such a “<strong id=\"\">social” society</strong> that 30% of men polled and 46% of women would rather go <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2008/12/21/not-tonight-dear-im-on-the-internet/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">two weeks without sex than live without the internet</strong></a>.  WOW!  Are you kidding me?  I said I love social media, but I wasn’t going that far!So what exactly should we be doing to increase reader engagement and connect with the very consumers we’re eagerly attempting to attract?  First we must focus on what our “<strong id=\"\">social interaction” </strong>goals are<strong id=\"\">.  </strong>Ask yourself:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Who is my customer?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How am I reaching them?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do they care about my message?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Are they listening?</li></ul><p>If they’re not listening, what is it that they’re not relating to?  Have you spelled out in clear terms what you have to offer, what they can’t live without and how you can <strong id=\"\">solve the problem</strong> they’re faced with?Social interaction and <strong id=\"\">business marketing </strong>combine two incredible forces.  By going social with your marketing efforts,  you have the opportunity to interact, captivate and call your fans, friends and followers to action.  But this means that as a business owner and entrepreneur you not only need to be <strong id=\"\">listening to your customers</strong>, but you must find a way to get their ear.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What's the Point?</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What am I using Social Media for?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Whose attention am I trying to gain?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is my style or personality and how will that shine through?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Am I staying true to my message?</li></ul><p>Getting your customers and potential clients to <strong id=\"\">actively “listen” to your message </strong>means you must refine your communication. Focus on what your customer wants; ask yourself everyday whether your message is what they’re interested in and stay true to your goals.Your social interaction whether it’s on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin or Active Rain should be an extension of who you are and a constant reminder to prospects, past clients and referral partners that you’re here to assist when they’re ready to make a move.</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The Naked Truth | Facing Your Blogging Fears</strong></p><p>I relate the <strong id=\"\">fear of blogging</strong> to a crazy dream I have every now and then.  In it I find myself standing naked in front of an audience.  How I came to speak in front of a large audience without knowing I had forgotten to get dressed is neither here nor there.  The point is that for me, the fear of blogging and the thought of the nightmare of standing naked before a crowd leaves me feeling exposed and vulnerable.  It can, obviously, be a complete show stopper.Finding the freedom within ourselves to write “authentically” is not something that comes naturally to all bloggers.  Whether it’s the fear of rejection or the fear of creating a “situation” (as my mother used to call it) can be debilitating.  But I believe that social media and blogging is all about being true to who you are, and the only way to convey that is through <strong id=\"\">authentic writing</strong>.<strong id=\"\">Blogging authentically</strong> is about knowing who you are as a writer.  How do you feel about a certain subject?  Would you take a stand one way or the other, and if so, are you willing to write about how you truly feel?  For many, being a bit controversial or putting our neck on the line for something we firmly believe in can be intimidating. What if no one agrees and hates my blog?  Or worse yet, what if no one cares or even comments?   Do you really care?  Your opinion is exactly that – your opinion.  OWN IT.  People will relate to you being true to yourself and those that don’t – they have to be true to themselves.  It probably means that they weren’t your target audience anyway.So how do you overcome your irrational <strong id=\"\">fear of blogging</strong>?  Just like anything else, you need to understand it.  Give yourself some time to really analyze what it is you’re afraid of.Face those fears by putting pen to paper.  Start with a simple blog about who you are, what you do for a living, where you live and why you’re blogging.  Is it for fun, for business or a little bit of both?  In this article I encourage you to have some fun.  If you’re funny, then show some humor.  If you’re serious about life, then convey that through your writing.  Whether it’s through a silly anecdote or a relatable true story, it’s that side of you that will engage your audience.The most important part is that you dive in and get started.  So pick a topic, grab and pen and get into the conversation!</p>",

They are the first point of contact between content and reader.They are the magnet that draws a reader in, making their effectiveness directly proportional to your results.Will they click the link, or move on to the next best thing?To grab attention and persuade the reader to hang around your blog for a while, you need to create a deliciously <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28689/How-to-Master-the-Art-of-Exceptional-Blog-Titles.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">irresistible blog post title</a>.As a marketer,understanding that while content is important, it is nothing without a title that will attract readers.Below are five simple ways to effectively market your content through clickable titles, but first, let's take a look at why spending time crafting the perfect title matters.</p><h1 id=\"\">Why Your Title Matters</h1><p><a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/twitter-headlines/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Copyblogger</a> expresses the importance of a catchy title:</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"On average, 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy, but only 2 out of 10 will read the rest. This is the secret to the power of your title, and why it so highly determines the effectiveness of the entire piece.\"</blockquote><p>Think of your title as the front entrance sign to your business.Do you want a flashy sign that <strong id=\"\">drives traffic to your blog</strong> or a lackluster sign that encourages those who might have been interested to keep on moving?  I can’t imagine the jury is out on this one.To maximize blog traffic, you need to <strong id=\"\">write alluring and persuasiveblog titles</strong> that <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/create-blog-content-that-spreads-like-wildfire/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">entice readers to click on your post</a>,  and also <strong id=\"\">keyword rich titles</strong> that will give search engines the ability to find you.</p><h5 id=\"\">So what exactly does that mean?</h5><h1 id=\"\">Your Blog Title Should:</h1><ol id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Pique curiosity and create excitement</li>\t<li id=\"\">Spell out the purpose of your article</li>\t<li id=\"\">Give a reason to take immediate action</li>\t<li id=\"\">Allow readers to find your post via keyword search</li></ol><h5 id=\"\">It’s the why, what and how of your article.</h5><p>Now that you know what your titles purpose is, you're ready to learn how to make it POP!</p><h1 id=\"\">Create a Deliciously Irresistible Blog Post Title</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Let the Reader Know What to Expect</h2><p>For a reader to feel the need to <a href=\"http://unbounce.com/content-marketing/how-to-write-an-attention-grabbing-blog-post-title/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">click on your article</a>, there must be something in it for them. Your title should immediately convey what they will learn, and how the reader will benefit.Which article are you more compelled to click through to:</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"The Importance of Active Community Participation\"</blockquote><p>Or would you rather click through to this one?</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"10 Dynamic Ways You Can Engage Your Audience\"</blockquote><p>While the first option might explain the \"what,\" it certainly isn't compelling. <strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">The bottom line:</em></strong> ensure that your title will stimulate the desire to know more.</p><h2 id=\"\">  2. Engage the Reader</h2><p>Engaging your reader requires that you predict the experience they will receive. Let your title be fun, witty, captivating, engaging and most of all - accurate.Let it challenge the reader to take action. People have a desire for knowledge. They also have unique needs and unanswered questions. If you can provide the solution, you have a much better chance of gaining readership.For example, lets say your niche is in SEO. You write an article and title it:</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"5 Changes Implemented by Google's Hummingbird Update\"</blockquote><p>This title answers the what, but does not answer the why or how. Why should your reader care and how will it help them? Instead, change that title to:</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"5 Changes Implemented by Google's Hummingbird Update ( and how your business can recover)</blockquote><p>The second title answers the question and provides a solution.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Be Straightforward</h2><p>In as much as it's important to be creative with your words, it is equally as important to keep them accurate and transparent.Have you ever clicked through to an article only to find a landing or sales page? Imagine your frustration when the article was sold as a \"how-to\" or solution when in reality it was a slick marketing tactic?That is exactly how your readers feel if you haven't properly \"sold\" the purpose of your article.Do away with the sales speak and focus on the message. What are you trying to convey?Your readers should quickly surmise what they will find on the other side of that click. Otherwise, you take the chance that they leave frustrated, never to return.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Include a Hook, but Keep it Concise</h2><p>According to <a href=\"http://unbounce.com/content-marketing/how-to-write-an-attention-grabbing-blog-post-title/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Unbounce</a>, there is an optimal blog post title length.</p><blockquote id=\"\">\"Eight words or less. Titles of eight words or less are the generally accepted standard and have been found to be the most effective. Twitter limits posts to 140 characters, and re-tweets add to the overall length of a tweet. Therefore, shorter titles are better suited for social sharing.\"</blockquote><p>As you work to keep your title short, make sure you include your hook, but never mislead your potential reader.The key is to strike a balance: include enough details in a fun and snappy way that intrigues and whets the readers appetite.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Make it Actionable</h2><p>The title needs to compel your reader to take action. After all, if a potential reader never clicks through to your article, were they ever a potential reader in the first place? Probably not.If you can't compel a browser to become a reader, your post may die an untimely death.</p><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">What are your top blog post title tips?

Let’s take a look at the <strong id=\"\">who, what and why of one of the fastest growing social circles, Google+ communities</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"\">What Are Google+ Communities</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"google+ communities\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282213f48759d2b5aea093_google%2B-communities.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Before we dive into the what and how of Google+ communities, let's first discuss what they are, what sets them apart from Facebook pages, and why they can be a real boon for your business.</p><p id=\"\">Simply put, <strong id=\"\">Google+ Communities are groups created for like-minded individuals to collaborate and discuss common interests</strong>.</p><p id=\"\">They provide a space where anyone can create, build, and foster a community of fans eager to engage with their business or brand. In a world of noise, they are one more way for marketers to build credibility and establish visibility in the online sphere.</p><p id=\"\">Similar to Facebook business pages, Google+ communities let members get actively involved in the conversation.</p><p id=\"\">Members are able to +1 (the equivalent of a like on Facebook), share and comment on your posts.</p><h2 id=\"\">Google+ Communities for Business</h2><p id=\"\">Are Google+ communities right for your business?</p><p id=\"\">To truly answer this question, I looked to a power user who would be willing to share her experience in the early stages of communities as well as some very valuable insight.</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com\" id=\"\">Peg Fitzpatrick</a> is a contributor to \"What the Plus!\" the unofficial Google+ handbook and co-moderator of the APE Google+ Community with authors Guy Kawasaki and Shawn Welch.</p><p id=\"\">She is a managing partner of the popular blog 12 Most, founder of My Book Club a monthly online book club, and a passionate blogger on her personal blog.</p><p id=\"\">As you can see, she is one busy lady and well qualified to help us identify opportunity in Google+ communities!</p><h2 id=\"\">The Who, What and Why of Google+ Communities</h2><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Q: As an active moderator on one of the largest Google+ communities, how do you feel they've been received?</strong></p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Peg:</strong> Communities really gave G+ a kick-start! Google+ is a passionate crew as a whole and they’ve whole-heartedly embraced starting and participating in communities. Day one of communities was an insane flurry of invitations and posts as people rushed to join in and check out the new toy they’d been given. I was impressed by many of the users who dove deeply into how communities worked.</p><p id=\"\">I was lucky enough to score an invite to Peter McDermott’s community for <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/115287855840632692408\" id=\"\">Community Moderators</a>, which has been a great source for knowledge, and to bounce ideas off other moderators.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Q: So now that you’ve had a little time to hang out, interact and moderate G+ Communities, where do you see the real value for businesses ready to take the plunge?</strong></p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Peg:</strong> I believe businesses will use Communities very successfully. The goal of the community would need to be established and figuring out if there is time to manage it. A Community is like a puppy, you might want it a lot at first but you need to remember that it will need to be fed and cared for everyday.</p><p id=\"\">If the business already has a thriving Facebook or LinkedIn community, you don’t want to bring it to G+ and replicate it. Your Google+ community should be unique and provide value to your members as well as your business.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Q; What advice would you share with your closest friends (and everyone reading this blog) that would have them quickly and easily using Google+ Communities effectively?</strong></p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Peg:</strong> Absolutely!

We decided to close this group and open a new private community. I think this was a very wise choice and I haven’t heard of any other communities that have done this. We accept everyone that requests to join our community but feel that the private community is a better choice.</p><p id=\"\">Before starting a community, make sure you review the Getting started with <a href=\"http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2888328&topic=2888488&ctx=topic\" id=\"\">Google+ Communities</a> guide.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">  2.

Read on!</p><h1 id=\"\">5 Steps to Creating An Active Social Media Community</h1><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">  </strong>1. Plan<strong id=\"\"> </strong></h2><p>Building your community takes planning. A pre-requisite to an effective plan is the efficient use of your time. To maximize your time spent on social media you must <a href=\"http://www.steamfeed.com/social-media-not-working-for-you-heres-why/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">identify  your target market</a>, understand their needs, and know how and when to meet them.Is your product or service aimed at young adults or senior citizens? Will the target market be of the rural variety or urban? There are many questions that have to be answered as you work through the planning process.Once you begin to build out your plan, make sure you choose a social platform that will allow you to target that market most efficiently and effectively while freeing up your time to engage, interact and build meaningful relationships.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What to Track</strong></h3><p>Tracking key indicators and analytics will give you the guidance needed when</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Keep track of what time during the day attracts the most attraction from potential consumers.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pinpoint specific keywords that work in engaging consumers (hash tags for Twitter).</li> \t<li id=\"\">Learn to eliminate any spam accounts that are being followed by your accounts.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Analyze what competitors are doing on their social media accounts.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Learn to schedule tweets (pre-timed) to maintain consistency.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Keep track of messages sent to your account and leave none unanswered.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">2. Make use of automated tools</h2><p>One of the biggest benefits of social media is the availability of automated tools to master just about any task. Many <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-time-management-tools-to-maximize-time-online/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">social media management tools</a> are free or available for a nominal cost.

Research</h2><p>Social media has varying platforms that offer a unique user experience. While some of your potential customers may choose to spend their time in the professional environment of LinkedIn, others may find the relaxed atmosphere of Facebook more to their liking. This makes it critical that <strong id=\"\">your business meet clients where they feel most comfortable</strong>.Time is a finite resource. Ten minutes spent on a low-payoff activity equals ten minutes not spent on a task beneficial to your businesses bottom line. Keep this in mind as you build out your social media strategy, making sure to <strong id=\"\">allocate certain time frames for specific activities</strong> such as responding to mentions or commenting on posts.The <strong id=\"\">biggest danger with social media is the user immersed in any specific activity to the extent that it dominates your life</strong>, leaving too little time for more important things.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Take Time to Explore</h2><p>Social media is an ever-expanding space. Developers publish new tools, apps and other resources almost on a daily basis. Such tools allow the you to<strong id=\"\"> perform daily to-do's better and faster</strong> and also enable new possibilities.Allocate some time to explore and experiment with such tools on a regular basis, taking time off from the daily grind. Consider this time an investment into a more efficient use of  the moments in your day.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Call it a Day</h2><p>Doing the same thing repeatedly soon leads to boredom and boredom leads to a lack of creativity. Avoid falling into this rut by getting up, walking away and shutting down the computer several times throughout the day.It is a <strong id=\"\">good social media time management practice</strong> to take a break from time to time and recharge ones batteries. The duration and periods of breaks depends on the individual and the nature of activities.Those are just a few of my <strong id=\"\">strategies to create an active social media community</strong>.

Now consider a social network that combines the engagement and reach available to your business on Facebook with a social network created with <strong id=\"\">search engine optimization</strong> in mind.  Combine those ingredients and together you have a force to be reckoned with.You have Google+.</p><p id=\"\">Yet <strong id=\"\">Google+</strong> is still regarded by many busineses as innefective.

This does not mean that it is not a useful site, only that there are fewer people interacting there.</li><li id=\"\">Your pages need to be managed through the Google+ interface. This can be a challenge as all other social media sites have been integrated into social media management systems such as Hootsuite or Tweetdeck. Each of those dashboards allow posts to be administered and distributed at the same time. Google+ has been very picky in who it integrates with so your third-party options will be limited.</li><li id=\"\">Google+ will take time to learn. That time could be used on other tasks.</li></ul><p id=\"\">While it is evident that Google+, like any other social network, will take additional energy to manage, I have found it to be well worth my time.

Now it seems that you're spending countless hours curating, creating and scheduling content.On top of that, you're trying to keep up with the latest tools and trends while maintaining an active presence.  Combine it all together and you have the makings for a <strong id=\"\">social media meltdown</strong>.It's no secret that <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/improve-social-media-strategy/\" id=\"\">social media</a> can be challenging to manage, but the good news is this. You can master it.In fact, you can improve not only your efforts but your message as well.The solutions below will help you make a few important tweaks to boost your results!</p><h1 id=\"\">Make the Most of Your Social Media Posts</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Keep it Simple</h2><p>Your social media followers and fans face a daily deluge of links, lists, tips, downloadable docs, and sales promotions.Standing out among that noise and elevating your business above your competition can feel difficult, but it’s not impossible.When you <strong id=\"\">prepare content for each social channel,</strong> don't overthink your posts. This is where I see a lot of business professionals run into trouble.While I know that giving an infinite amount of detail about your latest product can be tempting, the reality is that <strong id=\"\">sometimes simple will suffice</strong>.Think about it this way. Your customers are moving at hyper-speed when online. Mixing in short posts with your longer posts shakes things up. It also makes them easy to scan, share and respond to.As you cull through your content, offer enough valuable detail or insight to make it worthwhile reading but short enough to capture their attention.</p><blockquote id=\"\">As you prepare your content for each social channel, do not over-think your posts. Keep them short, sweet &amp; easy to SHARE! <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home/?status=As you prepare content for each social channel, do not over-think your posts. Keep them short, sweet and easy to SHARE! via @rebekahradice\" target=\" ”_blank”\" id=\"\">Tweet this!</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong> 2. Find the Right Mix</h2><p>Every one of your promotional posts or tweets should be balanced by informative, funny, engaging, or thought-provoking content.On top of your content, you should always <strong id=\"\">include a substantial amount of content that comes from followers, friends, and professionals</strong> that speak to your niche.The more you mix up your content, the quicker you understand what content your audience truly enjoys. And finding that sweet spot is where the true <strong id=\"\">social media magic begins</strong>.Those conversations around your brand, social shares, and website traffic will increase your reach and your potential for audience growth.</p><h5 id=\"\">The bottom line is this</h5><p>Turn your social media community into a captive audience by finding the right mix of content. Give freely of your knowledge, time, and insight.This will build trust and allow them to become a marketing extension of your business.As Pam Moore, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.pammarketingnut.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Marketing Nutz</em></a> says<em id=\"\">,</em></p><blockquote id=\"\">You can never go wrong by investing in communities and the human beings within them.</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">  3. Keep it Interesting</h2><p>Keep people involved and coming back with fun and interesting information. Share a beautiful image, a heartwarming story, or a behind-the-scenes look into your business. In other words, <strong id=\"\">give fans and followers content they will want to interact with and share</strong>.Monitor your sites so you can respond to comments or questions quickly. Make use of your special expertise to give advice. For example, a series of useful tips pertaining to your specific industry is valuable information many people will want to share.Fluff is nice, but information that can be used to save money, make money, and win in negotiations will keep an audience tuned in.  Don’t try to sneak in a product message: just provide general information that’s helpful for the average consumer.The <strong id=\"\">quickest path I know to get people talking and returning to your social channels</strong> is to share information with no strings attached. The better your giveaway, the more valuable your content, and the more buzz you'll create.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. Spread the Word</h2><p>Of course, you can advertise your site.  Sites like Facebook, Google, and Twitter offer advertising options, but it may be a budget-buster as the return might not justify the expense.Start small by ensuring that all current marketing collateral – including your business card, brochures and emails – lists your social sites.<strong id=\"\">Combining your online and offline efforts</strong> will create a greater sense of awareness.Let each opportunity you interact with consumers serve as a reminder of where past, current and potential customers can circle, like or follow you.</p><h3 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>While everyone must find their own unique voice, it’s important to interject enough of you into your social media presence that people enjoy connecting and engaging.If you’re simply pushing out the same old stuff, your competitor is, <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/outshine-competition-online/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">finding a differentiating factor</a> will be difficult.Be unique, be informative, but most of all, be YOU!<strong id=\"\">What step can you take today to improve your social media posts tomorrow?</strong></p>",

It creates an even larger chasm between small business and accessible self promotion.It's a large enough deterrent to keep the average marketer from taking advantage of Facebook advertising.So how can you capitalize on the power of Facebook ads while maintaining your sanity (and budget)?Say hello to boosted posts with Facebook promoted posts.</p><h1 id=\"\">How to Use Facebook Promoted Posts to Boost Business Page Buzz</h1><h2 id=\"\">The Scoop on a Facebook Promoted Post</h2><p>Promoted posts are an easy way for business page owners to <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/4-powerful-ways-to-increase-facebook-fan-page-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">build engagement</a> and invigorate a potentially fatal fan base.Never used them? Here's the skinny...Promoted posts offer two opportunities:</p><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Gain the attention of fans that no longer see posts in their news feed</li> \t<li id=\"\">Build a new fan base by reaching the friends of your fans</li></ol><p>With Facebook promoted posts, a business page can pay for the promotion of an individual post.This gives you increased exposure by placing your page in the news feed of more fans and friends of fans than typically reached.A promoted post is also quantifiable.Similar to a Facebook ad, page admins are able to track the metrics of each promoted post. At the bottom of your post you will see how many people that specific post reached along with how many new likes to the post or page you received.If you want to test out promoted posts, there are a several key things to remember.</p><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Promoted posts are only available to pages with a minimum of 400 likes.</li> \t<li id=\"\">You are only able to run promotions on posts published after June 21, 2012.</li> \t<li id=\"\">You cannot choose the date and time your post runs. Once your promoted post is approved, it will run until your goal has been met.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Any type of content can be promoted including images, links, videos and status updates. A good rule of thumb is to promote a post that's visually appealing, offers exclusive or time restrictive content or promotes an upcoming event.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Once you’ve promoted a post you can always pause it, cancel it or adjust your budget. You will only be charged based on the results received at that point.</li></ol><h2 id=\"\">How to Boost Posts With Facebook Promoted Posts</h2><h3 id=\"\">  1.  Choose the post you want to promote</h3><p>Click on the promote button on the lower right side of the post to get started.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221226a472d187a4f182_how-to-use-facebook-boosted-posts-1100x1158.png\" alt=\"how-to-use-facebook-boosted-posts\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">  2.  Determine your audience</h3><p>A big mistake many make is promoting to current fans only. This is where targeted marketing becomes your best friend.Get specific based on interests, similar pages, location, and more.The goal is to put your boosted post in front of:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">A new audience</li> \t<li id=\"\">A group of people eager to engage with your content</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">  3.  Set your budget</h3><p>With as little as $2 per day, you can reach a targeted audience.So think about it, how long do you want to run this ad and how many people do you want to reach?My suggestion is to limit it to a $5 budget when you're just getting started.And don't go crazy on that audience. Make it specific and relevant or no one is going to click and those that do...They're not actually going to buy from you or engage with your page.</p><h3 id=\"\">  4.  Click save</h3><p>Once you do, your post is submitted for review to the Facebook ads team.As soon as it's approved,  you'll receive a confirmation email.You're now off to the races!</p><h2 id=\"\">Monitor Your Progress</h2><p>Savvy marketers monitor their progress and then adjust their strategy based on statistical data.First, take a look at your results. Click on \"View Results\" to access your data.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221226a472e1a5a4f183_how-to-boost-facebook-posts-1100x1401.png\" alt=\"how-to-boost-facebook-posts\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Best practices when using Facebook promoted posts:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Assign an ad name to each of your promoted posts making it much easier to track their effectiveness.</li> \t<li id=\"\">By default, Facebook targets the United States plus many other countries. If reaching fans in say the Ukraine isn’t your target, go ahead and make the necessary adjustments so you don’t waste time or budget on an irrelevant audience.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Perform a split test to check the effectiveness of this new tool rather then just pushing ahead blindly.</li> \t<li id=\"\">A simple way to conduct a split test is to send out a Sponsored Page Post Ad and a Promoted Post to page fans only.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Monitor your progress and determine which method garners the best results.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Determine what type of post you want to promote. It might be a sweepstakes or a new product rollout. Whatever the case, choose wisely.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your goal is increased engagement so make the post fun, appealing and easy to respond to. You will receive a lot more feedback when you choose a topic your fans are passionate about and one that doesn’t require much thought to take action.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Be careful not to get too “click happy” with promoted posts.  There is an option to always promote your most recent post. Choosing this option can blow a media budget quickly. You're better off to specifically select the posts you want to push into the news feed.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">The Pros and Cons of Promoted Posts</h2><p>If you're already receiving significant reach on your posts, promoted posts may not be for you.But more than likely, you're like the typical page struggling to get seen in the news feed.Spending additional advertising dollars is not necessary as your base is already actively seeking out your page.If your reach is under 2%, promoted posts are worth considering and may help you re-engage and reconnect with fans that haven’t seen your posts in a while.One excellent advantage of the promoted post?Unlike Facebook ads seen on the right sidebar, promoted posts can reach mobile users.That feature alone makes them an intriguing option for many marketers.</p><h3 id=\"\">Over to you...</h3><p>Will you consider Facebook promoted posts?I'd love to hear your future marketing plans in the comments below!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Today we see more and more businesses utilizing social media as an avenue to expand their business.Businesses are beginning to see the value a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/how-to-set-up-and-optimize-a-facebook-page/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook business page</a> can offer by allowing them to connect with raving fans and potential customers while maintaining bonds with current ones.We all know these Facebook pages are littered with coupons, promos, and product details.Pages like this trigger the assumption that you are only after their money, which may or may not be true.Some businesses, however, are missing the mark completely when it comes to giving their fans <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/24-ideas-to-rock-your-social-media-content-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">valuable and engaging content</a>If the above describes your Facebook page, have no fear, there is hope!</p><h1 id=\"\">4 Things Your Facebook Fans Crave (and how to give it to them)</h1><p>Your page should be a delicate balance of content that matters to your customer with a touch of product/service promotion, not the other way around.It's a fact that consumers are more likely to <a href=\"http://www.webpronews.com/facebook-twitter-influence-psychology-of-online-shopping-habits-2012-03\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">buy from businesses</a> with whom they are familiar and have a relational bond.  How do you build bonds with your offline customers while online?Give them what they want!</p><h2 id=\"\"> 1.  They Crave To Know You Are Human</h2><p>All business all the time is boring.  Your customers are looking to see that they are dealing with real people who understand their needs and know how to supply them with a solution to those needs.Adding your own personal flavor to your Facebook business page will intrigue your fans as you allow them a peek inside the world of your business.  This can be showing pictures or videos of you or your staff doing what you do best, these real-life examples show that you are confident in what you do and help people know what to expect when they walk in your door.</p><h2 id=\"\">2.  People Crave To Be Heard</h2><p>Fielding requests or questions online can go a long way.  Sometimes the difference between a raving fan and a disgruntled customer is how you handle their inquiry.Make the effort to reach out to these requests, even if you do not have an answer at that time, acknowledge that they have been heard, and ensure that you will follow up with them shortly.Then actually follow up.  This shows that you go the extra mile for your customers, which spreads like wildfire regarding word-of-mouth referrals.</p><h2 id=\"\">3.  Fans Crave Honesty</h2><p>Today more people than ever check out a business online before choosing to work with them.  They want to see if the business is credible, competent, and conducts itself in an honest manner.Being transparent is an important value to have because all shortcomings are eventually brought to light.  The good news is that everyone is human, and we are bound to mess up, but it is how we handle what comes; next that will determine whether people stay or go.If you honestly handle yourself in the digital and physical world, people will notice and take note of that. However, those will eventually be found if you conduct yourself in sketchy or unethical ways.Make the hard decision, and do what's right from the get-go.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. People Crave A Good Laugh</h2><p>Nothing brings people back to your Facebook page like a good laugh.  If you can share hilarious content with your fans consistently, they will know where to go when they need to lighten their spirits.If this is done in careful balance with the rest of the content you put out on your page, then you've probably struck gold.<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/06/19/how-to-get-more-likes-shares-on-facebook-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Humorous posts get shared most frequently</a> via social media sites, especially Facebook, where photo memes seem to take over.Also make sure that your posts are never offensive and somehow relate to your business or industry, and you will have your fans spreading your content to the far corners of the web.  This is a great way to peak the interest of friends of your fans, which turn into new fans and potential customers.If you give your fans the attention, they require as well as valuable content consistently, you will begin to build a loyal Facebook following that will eventually be invaluable to your business.  It may take time, but the investment is worth it.What kind of content or attention does your audience crave, and how do you satisfy their craving?

I am taking leave of that today to focus on a topic that is crucial to anyone’s success, whether you are a large or small company. who is looking to earn a voice within the crowded social media space.Today I want to focus on you. The ‘you’ that has hopes, dreams, and passions that lies well beyond social media. They are the passions that drive you, inspire you and propel you towards excellence each and every day.They are the substance by which your business was built and the glue that keeps your well-oiled machine moving forward.</p><h1 id=\"\">Getting Social or Losing Steam</h1><p>While it is no secret that social media can be an enormous boon to your business, it can also be a massive time waster. This new must have toy for business professionals can and will slowly eat into your time, invade your life and eventually steal your passion if you allow it.As a business owner, social networking is your online connection to customers and potential clients.  It is an opportunity to turn your fans, followers, readers and subscribers into raving fans and ultimately, marketing evangelists.However, social media marketing while seemingly free does take a toll if not managed. This makes it critical to get organized. Organization will save you time, frustration and the overwhelming feeling that you must spend every waking moment commenting, liking, tweeting, blogging and friending . The other thing organization does is keep you from spending too much time talking or selling and not enough time living. Remember, social media cannot wave a magic wand and miraculously cure your marketing woes. It takes time, practice and a consistent commitment to your end goal.</p><h1 id=\"\">Are You Growing Your Business or Your Life</h1><p>While you have the opportunity to grow your business in new and exhilarating ways, social media  will backfire if you do not stay firmly entrenched in what makes you tick; that essence that proves you are beautiful and distinct.Each of us possess our own unique abilities and with that, our own interests and passions that define who we are at the very core.  Are you spending enough time on what matters to you?  Are you feeding your passion?Making space for the important stuff, those things that you have slowly pushed out of your life, is tougher to do every day as we are bombarded by the ‘noise’ of social media and other time-sucking activities.The bottom line for me, and what I hope resonates with you as well, is that we either choose to make the time for what matters most, drives us forward and feeds our passion or eventually the time will be filled with worthless mind-numbing details.Which details do you choose to spend your time focused on?

While still in its infancy, with an estimated 20 million users, this social behemoth can no longer be ignored.However, even with its seemingly simple way to share and bookmark web content, the <strong id=\"\">potential of Pinterest</strong> is still widely misunderstood by business owners. If you are eager to <strong id=\"\">reign in the power of Pinterest</strong>, but unsure where to begin, the 7 tips below will allow you to jump start your Pinterest presence!</p><h1 id=\"\">7 Ways to Build Your Business with Pinterest</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. Share Your Content</h2><p>Whether it is your latest blog post, video or e-book, pinning your content will establish you as the expert in your field and catch the attention of consumers interested in your service or product.When you pin an article from your website you create a link back to that article. You are not only building traffic back to your website, but creating a resource for anyone researching your topic. When you initially set up your Pinterest boards, group your pins based on topic. This will make it easy for anyone searching that particular keyword to find your content.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"pinterest board ideas\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822116a10ecd64256d988_pinterest-board-ideas.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">   2. Create Fun and Unique Boards</h2><p>Create boards that are not only specific to your niche, but also fun, engaging and unique to your business. If you are a local business,<strong id=\"\"> </strong>design a board that shares your favorite restaurants, vendors and places to visit.If you are a national brand, share Infographics based on recent market statistics, photos that include a quote taken from your most recent blog post or an image containing a key takeaway from your latest webinar.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"pinterest quotes\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822116a10ec178a56d987_pinterest-quotes.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  3. Use the Pin-It Button</h2><p>Use the Pinterest pin-it button to quickly pin your latest blog, video or product update. With each \"pin,' you create a direct link to your content. It also allows for an easy way to curate content that can be quickly shared by your followers. When you pin your own content, do not forget to click \"edit\" once you've pinned the item and add  to your description the direct link to your article, video or photo.If you are pinning material that is not your own, make sure to credit the original source in your description.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"ultimate_pinterest_cheat_sheet\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822116a10ec801f56d985_ultimate_pinterest_cheat_sheet.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\"> 4. Add the Pinterest Button to Your Website</h2><p>Pinterest offers two tools that make it easy for readers to share your content and connect with you on Pinterest.  The \" Pin It \" and \"Follow Me on Pinterest\" buttons can be added to both your website and blog.To add directly from Pinterest, go to the <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/about/goodies/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Goodies</a> section and install the \"Follow Button\" and \"Pin It Button\" on your website. The code will automatically populate making it easy to copy and paste in to your site.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"pinterest_pin_it_button_website\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822116a10ec1ece56d986_pinterest_pin_it_button_website.png\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  5. Give a Sneak Peek into Your Company</h2><p>Give a behind-the-scenes look in to your business that includes:</p><ul id=\"\">\t<li id=\"\">Event or conference photos</li>\t<li id=\"\">A historical timeline that documents important dates within your business</li>\t<li id=\"\">Photos of the people that support your business</li>\t<li id=\"\">Blogs, photos, tips and other items that are favorites of your staff</li></ul><p>The ideas are limitless when you consider what you can share. The goal is simple: give your Pinterest followers a unique look in to what makes your business tick.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Promote Upcoming Products</h2><p>If you are looking to drive additional traffic to your website or blog, adding pins related to upcoming products can create excitement and boost awareness. Share links to your promo video or article announcing the roll-out.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7.  Add Pinterest to Your Facebook Page</h2><p>Adding Pinterest to your Facebook page is a great way to cross promote your social media channels. It is easy to integrate and will display within Facebook just as it would be seen in  Pinterest.The easiest and cleanest application I have found is Woobox.

Together they build brand awareness and boost your online visibility. <a href=\"http://clicktotweet.com/f5tZT\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Tweet This!</a></blockquote><p>How's that?As people begin to know, like and trust you, they will also start to retweet, share and interact with you.</p><h3 id=\"\">TIP: <strong id=\"\">Don't Focus on the Number</strong></h3><p>When you first start using Twitter, it is easy to become consumed with your follower count.Rather than worrying about followers that have no bearing on your business, focus instead on building a small, tight-knit community that is excited to share your content.Use Twitter applications to locate people tweeting about your niche. Then get involved in the conversation.Either start one or get involved in one. But first find the right people.These are the people who will either buy from you, hire you or are influencers within your industry. You need to know who they are and what their favorite topics are.One of my favorite applications to find those people is <a href=\"https://followerwonk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Followerwonk</a>.

Brands, whether large or small, with a consistent <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/7-simple-steps-to-build-and-promote-your-facebook-fan-page\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook marketing strategy</a> have the ability to build a viable community in an entertaining environment.However, simply showing up is not enough. As the social sphere evolves, so do the needs of the consumer. Meeting those needs by providing valuable content in an easy to digest format allows potential clients to get to know your brand on a far more intimate level.So why then do so many businesses fail at Facebook marketing before they even begin? A lack of planning, goal setting and visibility.Whether you are considering Facebook marketing or are simply frustrated with your current lack of results, spend time optimizing and properly setting up your page</p><h2 id=\"\">Set Up and Optimize Your Facebook Page</h2><p>If you do not currently have a personal Facebook profile, you must first sign up for a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\" id=\"\">free account</a>. Since your business page is tied and managed via your personal account, you cannot proceed without first completing this step. If you already have a Facebook profile, proceed to step number two.1.  Log in to your personal Facebook profile, open a new tab and then begin the process of creating your new <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php\" id=\"\">Facebook business page</a>.2.  The type of business you choose will depend on whether you work locally or nationally, are a brand, product or public figure. Read through each option and consider which suits you best before moving forward.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282211271573020b996089_create-a-facebook-business-page.png\" alt=\"create a facebook business page\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>3.  Choose the category that best describes your business from the category drop down.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221127157364a199608a_set-up-facebook-business-page-2.png\" alt=\"set up facebook business page 2\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>4.  The “business or place” box is where you will enter the name of your page. Choose this based on how you have branded yourself up until this point.</p><blockquote id=\"\">TIP: Think through whether you have branded your name e.g. “Ann Smith” or your office e.g. “ABC Marketing Company.” It is important to stay consistent in your branding.</blockquote><p>Once you determine the name of your page, you will then enter business contact information, click ‘I agree” and then “Get Started.”Your page is now complete! Now it is time to customize your page.5.  Choose your profile picture. This is the image that will fall below your cover image. You can choose to either upload from your computer or import from a website.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428221127157311e399608b_choose_image.png\" alt=\"choose_image\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>6.  Complete the 'About' section. It is important to make it as easy as possible for potential fans to quickly identify and understand what your page is all about. Add your “bio” in this section as well as all contact information, i.e. Website, Twitter, LinkedIn and any other link.</p><blockquote id=\"\">TIP: Use Keywords in the “About” Section: Your keyword-loaded about section will help brand your business as well as allow potential fans to find you.  Create a captivating 'about' including a tagline that will make people think of your business every time they hear it.</blockquote><p>7.  Upload your cover photo - With the introduction of Timeline came the new cover photo. Think of your cover photo like you would a movie trailer. A movie trailer has a short amount of time to thrill, inspire and drive consumers to action. Likewise, your cover photo is a quick snapshot of your business and an immediate way to capture the attention of anyone visiting your page. Use it to express the value of your business, but pay close attention to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/search/?q=cover+guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook's strict photo cover guidelines</a>.Take a look at a few creative examples of how companies are using their cover photo:Dunkin' Donuts updates their cover photo each week to promote their \"Fan of the Week\"</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282211271573337499608e_Dunkin-Donuts-Cover-Photo.jpeg\" alt=\"Dunkin Donuts Cover Photo\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Coca-Cola as a brand truly understands their fans and commits the page to telling their story</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/64282211271573410099608f_Coca-Cola-cover-photo.jpeg\" alt=\"Coca-Cola cover photo\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The magic of Disney is transferred from our childhood memories to their Facebook page on a daily basis</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822112715731d2699608d_Disney-cover-photo.jpeg\" alt=\"Disney cover photo\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>8.  Your last step is to choose your Facebook vanity url. This is a branding and SEO opportunity that you do not want to pass up. If you are not prepared to choose a url at this time,  simply click skip and come back to <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/username\" id=\"\">www.facebook.com/username</a> when you are ready. A vanity url is important for several reasons:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">You make your page easy to find by allowing users to type in the exact name of your page e.g. <a href=\"http://facebook.com/company-name\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">http://facebook.com/company-name</a></li> \t<li id=\"\">You now have a direct link to use in all other marketing efforts</li> \t<li id=\"\">An optimized url boosts your page SEO</li></ul><blockquote id=\"\">TIP: An optimized url brands you or business by use of keywords or terms. Just as your page name should reflect your current branding, so should your page url. You also want to keep this consistent with your page name. If you decided on the page name “Ann Smith,” then choosing  <a href=\"http://facebook.com/AnnSmith\" id=\"\">http://facebook.com/AnnSmith</a> will resonate best with past and current clients. Likewise, if you are branding your company, then consider sticking with that name. You also want to keep in mind the standard for SEO title tags when naming your page. Limit your title (name of page) to 70 characters or less if possible.</blockquote><p>Congratulations! You are now a Facebook page administrator and able to begin networking and connecting!</p>",

Look no further than Facebook!You can drive growth, build momentum, and increase Facebook fan page engagement with a few simple strategies.Keeping your fans alert, involved, and eager to contribute is imperative to your page showing up in their newsfeed.These tips will help you stay in front of your fans and take them from fan to paying clients!</p><h1 id=\"\">4 Powerful Ways to Increase Facebook Fan Page Engagement</h1><h1 id=\"\">1. Use Images</h1><p>Images are a powerful way to quickly earn a reaction from your fans. They have the ability to excite, inspire, and delight. Images can generate an instantaneous and strong emotional response.With the rollout of Timeline, images are more influential than ever. In a recent survey by <a href=\"http://lp.wildfireapp.com/rs/wildfire/images/OptimizingContentfortheNewTimelineFormat_ATrackingStudyof43Brands.pdf\" id=\"\">Wildfire</a>, it was found that posts with graphics garner a much greater response than those without. In fact, Wildfire stated that “Photos are the best at generating comments, outperforming the next best post type by 8.3%.”This does not mean you need to include a graphic with every one of your posts, but it does offer important insight into capturing the attention of your fans.Your images can stand alone with nothing more than one or two words needed. The Ellen DeGeneres Show employs this tactic with exceptional results consistently:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822110480caa471c3dd5a_Increase-Facebook-Fan-Page-Engagement.jpeg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Fan Page Engagement\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Another strategy is one that I use quite often when posting a blog or web article. Include your eye-popping image along with the link or URL at the end of your Facebook post. Your image will immediately draw them in and hopefully entice them to click through to your article.</p><h1 id=\"\">2. Use a Clear Call to Action</h1><p>A strong call to action includes a simple request leaving no doubt in your fan's minds about what you would like them to do.  Never leave fan reaction to chance. Give them a compelling reason to take action via consistent, relevant, and beneficial content.A few ways you can encourage a specific reaction is through open-ended questions. For example:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Fill in the blank: Have you ever _____?</li> \t<li id=\"\">We __________. What do you think?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your favorite __________?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What if you could _________?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Finish this sentence:  ________</li> \t<li id=\"\">We love _________. What’s your favorite?</li></ul><p>Another simple way to direct your fans is by spelling out the specific action you would like them to take. Do not assume your fans know what you want them to do. Tell them!</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">LIKE this post if…</li> \t<li id=\"\">Click LIKE if you agree, if you love, if you could…</li> \t<li id=\"\">SHARE if you love this as much as we do or if you’ve found this valuable</li> \t<li id=\"\">Tag yourself in this photo if you agree…</li></ul><h1 id=\"\">3. Use a Status Update</h1><p>There is no denying that a simple status update still packs a punch whether you are a big brand or a mom-and-pop shop. The status update is easy to relate to your fans in a fun and entertaining way without the complication of images, links, or video.One big brand that uses this strategy almost exclusively is Skittles. Their fans have come to know and appreciate the short, witty, and entertaining way the brand endears itself to its fans daily.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822110480ca35b7c3dd59_skittles-300x144.png\" alt=\"skittles\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h1 id=\"\">4. Use Video</h1><p>While images are powerful, video can be just as effective. However, people are moving quickly when they are on Facebook, so keep your videos short, informative, and entertaining.You want your fans to walk away feeling uplifted, encouraged, or as if they have gained wisdom and knowledge from your video.</p><h4 id=\"\">Set yourself apart by offering enormous value, and watch your message spread like wildfire!

To gain attention in the Twittersphere, you need to put a few simple steps into place.Here's how you can begin building your business with Twitter right now!</p><h1 id=\"\">6 Simple Steps to Building Your Business with Twitter</h1><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Optimize Your Bio</strong></h2><p>There are many ways to optimize your Twitter profile, but your bio or “about” section provides multiple opportunities.It is the first thing anyone visiting your profile will read and is indexed based on your keywords. This makes your Twitter bio a very powerful marketing tool. Take the time to determine how to capitalize on this brief, albeit weighty, word count.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Business vs. Personal</strong></h3><p>While it is important to add essential details about your business, business does not makeup 100% of your life. Using the 280 characters on Twitter, you can inject fun tidbits about who you are personally and those things that matter most to you.What do you enjoy doing when you are not working? For example, my bio includes my love of coffee, sunshine, and my two dogs. Those are three things that make me smile.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/642822110cb3c833038289f8_Rebekah-Radice-Twitter-Bio.png\" alt=\"Rebekah Radice Twitter Bio\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Let people peek into your life outside of the office.

Like I said above, have fun with your bio and allow organic conversations with like-minded individuals to start taking place!</li> \t<li id=\"\">The words you use in your bio are searchable keywords so keep them specific to what you want to be found for. (e.g. your hometown, company name, and industry or category)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Add additional ways followers can connect with you, including your company website (make sure it reads like this: http:// and not www) or Twitter profile (e.g. @xyzcompany)</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> 2. Use Twitter Lists</strong></h2><p>Twitter lists are a way to group users together by some common thread. For example, you might create a list of people who tweet about a topic that you want to follow daily, such as social media. The idea is to make these tweets easily accessible. This allows you to keep up with certain tweeters without the hassle of searching for them every time.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Twitter List Ideas:</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">People included in a group that you belong to</li> \t<li id=\"\">People that are tweeting regularly about a #hashtag that you follow</li> \t<li id=\"\">Twitter followers that are part of your local area (city, state or community)</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your favorite authors or celebrities</li> \t<li id=\"\">Travel tweets that help you plan your next vacation</li> \t<li id=\"\">Local businesses (e.g. coffee shop, restaurant, etc)</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> 3. Follow people with similar interests</strong></h2><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Find people to follow and connect via Twitter directories such as Twellow and WeFollow. Both sites can introduce you to Twitter users that have the same interests as yours.</li> \t<li id=\"\">If you belong to industry-specific groups, pay attention to who is actively participating. Read through their bio to determine whether or not you share common interests.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Follow people that your influencers follow. Again, check their bio to determine if there is a fit or not.  Staying focused on your niche will make it easy for you to build a community centered around similar interests.</li></ol><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> 4. Get in the conversation</strong></h2><p>Once you follow, begin to engage. Retweet their content, comment on a tweet or share your thoughts on their latest blog post. You will figure out very quickly who is on Twitter to interact and who is simply using it as a one-way bullhorn to build their business.The more conversation you can create, the quicker you will find your own voice and posting rhythm.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> 5. Share content and update your status daily</strong></h2><p>The biggest struggle is always centered around content. The question is where to find tweetable content, what to talk about and how to best curate it. My answer is always the same. You likely have an immense amount of content at your fingertips, and you just don't realize it. Here are a few ideas on where you might have content hiding and how to share it.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Dependent on your target audience, you can share anything from customer photos to your weekly product special. People tend to forget that you can share photos on Twitter as well as Facebook</li> \t<li id=\"\">Links to your latest blog post</li> \t<li id=\"\">Details about an upcoming event you are promoting or a local charity that you support</li> \t<li id=\"\">Insider tips that help your customer through the buying process</li> \t<li id=\"\">Customer testimonials</li> \t<li id=\"\">Q&amp;A using questions frequently asked about your business or service</li></ul><p>Think through what content you have on your website or blog and already created on your current marketing materials, such as flyers or newsletters.Re-purposing your content is the name of the game. Do not feel compelled to reinvent the wheel.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> 6. Integrate Twitter with other social networks</strong></h2><p>Integrate your social networks into your website and blog through social plugins and the Facebook LIKE box. When you post to your blog, make sure you tweet it out to your followers and not just once. Tweet it throughout the week, but change the verbiage and monitor your results.</p><h3 id=\"\">What additional ways are you using <em id=\"\">Twitter to build your business</em>?</h3>",

      "wp-content": "<p>As the Internet buzzes about with social media activity, identifying what sites provide the <strong id=\"\">best networking opportunity</strong> is simply a mouse click away.While LinkedIn Networking may be viewed as an online resume, it moves to the top of my list for professional networking.  Look outside of your preconceived notion and you will see that <strong id=\"\">LinkedIn provides visibility for the business professional</strong> looking to establish themselves as a subject matter expert.While Facebook, Twitter and other social sites build familiarity and awareness for your personal brand, LinkedIn is unique in its business focus. LinkedIn is a society designed to connect business professionals, marketers and vendors interested in building a community.LinkedIn's growth over the last several years also builds a strong case for utilizing this site for more than a static resume.  With over 150 million users, LinkedIn is growing at a speed of more then 2 new members per second according to LinkedIn statistics.That translates into a lot of missed opportunity if you haven’t taken the time to connect with professionals within your community and across the country.</p><h1 id=\"\">LinkedIn:  Your Online Networking Connection</h1><p>Before diving in, make sure your personal LinkedIn profile is complete.  There’s nothing worse than attempting to connect with business professionals with an incomplete bio and resume.If this is you, take a quick moment to log into your account and walk through each step until you’re 100% complete!  Do not proceed until this is done.Once you have entered all of your information from past employment to contact details, begin finding ways to connect and be seen.</p><h2 id=\"\">  1.  LinkedIn Groups</h2><p>Join <a href=\"http://learn.linkedin.com/groups/\" id=\"\">groups on LinkedIn</a> and start a conversation or comment on topics relevant to your niche.  You will find groups by by searching keywords or topics to identify groups with similar interests.Click on Groups and then “Groups Directory”to research featured groups that offer content that you find interesting.You can create your own Group in a few easy steps.  Think about who you are trying to attract or who your target audience is.  Do a little research and see what other Groups might already be out there and what they are doing right or wrong in your opinion. How can you improve upon it and add value to the community?</p><h2 id=\"\">  2.  Ask and Answer Questions</h2><p>Click on the \"More\" tab.Choose “Answers” to ask or answer questions relevant to your industry.  Navigate to the \"Advanced Answers Search\" toolbar and choose your topic or enter your keyword.  You can choose to view only unanswered questions or view all questions within that category.Answering questions is another great way to establish your presence within the community and in your industry.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3.  Check Your Skills</h2><p>Click on the \"More\" tab:Choose \"<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/skills/?trk=skill-rank\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Skills</a>” to locate top professionals in your area of expertise. You can establish connections with other experts in your niche from anywhere in the world or choose to focus on a particular city or region.The skills section also gives you an advantage by aggregating information from top professionals within your field.  Stay ahead of your competition by researching skills required to succeed in todays market.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4.  Find Events in Your Field or City</h2><p>Click on the \"More\" tab.Choose \"Events\" to find local, regional, and national events based on your interests no matter the location.  LinkedIn will also identify events they believe you might be interested in.If you are ready to \"get local\" and engage with your community face-to-face, locating events is a great way to do it!</p><h2 id=\"\">  5.  Make Your Connections Count</h2><p>LinkedIn is an excellent way to connect with like-minded business professionals.  There are, however, a few rules you must abide by and a few \"don'ts\" you must avoid.Don't send requests to connect without customizing the standard LinkedIn email verbiage. Whenever you send a friend request, LinkedIn will by default send your request along with this message: \"I use LinkedIn to keep track of my professional network, and would like to add you.\" Sounds great, right?  Wrong!That cookie-cutter message does not give any indication of who you are or why you want to connect.  Spend a few moments scripting out a short explanation of why you are interested in connecting, who you are and what your business is all about.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6.  Get Networking</h2><p>The ideas above barely scratch the surface of the limitless possibility you have to make connections on LinkedIn. If you are ready to expand your reach, then capitalize on this burgeoning community.If you are willing to put in the time, LinkedIn truly has the ability to establish credibility, open doors of opportunity and expand your personal brand.</p>",

Sadly, you are not alone.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker\" id=\"\">Lurking</a> is a common ailment affecting many a reader who claims “they don’t have time to comment” or they “wouldn’t know what to say” and so instead pop in and out without a word.That affliction has been given a name and this week we celebrate your coming out party!  It's <a href=\"http://papernapkin.typepad.com/\" id=\"\">National Delurking Week.</a>..a time for you to let the world know you exist by stepping out of the shadows and letting your voice be heard!National DeLurking Week might sound a little creepy, but its intentions absolutely are not. Started in 2007, this cry to lurkers to join in the conversation is your chance to step out from behind your computer and into the social media community.</p><h1 id=\"\">Stop Lurking and Get in the Conversation</h1><p>Rather than spending your time lurking, why not make your presence known?!   It’s as simple as choosing a few of your favorite blogs and commenting with your thoughts or questions for the blogger. Today is your day to DeLurk and share your thoughts!Step 1:  Log in to your favorite RSS reader (mine would be <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader\" id=\"\">Google  Reader</a>) and pick 3 of your favorite blogs.Step 2:  Read the blog and log in to comment.  This is typically done via Facebook or Twitter.Step 3:  Leave a comment!  It only takes a moment to let the author know you care.  You may LOVE their blog, but you have never expressed it.  Today is the day to PAY IT FORWARD!</p><h1 id=\"\">Hyper Local Marketing Idea:</h1><p>If you are an active blogger, you are well aware of the challenges surrounding “lurkers.”  You see the traffic, you know they’ve stopped by, yet the lack of comments tell a different story.  This is the week where you will change all of that.  Pull your readers out of the shadows and get them involved and interacting!Ask questions that generate conversation:1.  What is your favorite outdoor activity in (insert your city or neighborhood)?2.  If you were speaking to someone who was just moving to (insert your city or neighborhood) what would your #1 recommendation be?3.  What is the best part about living in (insert your city or neighborhood)?4.  What are your favorite sites to see in (insert your city or neighborhood)?5.  What one attraction is a “must do” in (insert your city or neighborhood)?The list of questions can go on and on, but the objective is the same.  Get your readers engaged, conversing and interactive with your blog. You can even wet their appetite by offering a prize for the best comment.Whatever you do, have fun and stop lurking!  Get started now and leave a comment.  I'd love to hear how you will make the most of this week!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>My legs are tired today, but pushing your limits can do that. With each step I take, I am reminded of a decision that emits both a smile and a wince. I decided to add an extra mile to my daily bike ride this month.While I have no doubt that I will feel the incredible joy that comes from meeting (and making) a goal such as this, for now  it is leaving me tired and achy. A feeling that I can relate to both personally as well as professionally.As someone who spends their days <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/7-sources-of-inspiration-for-writing-sizzling-social-media-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">managing and creating a social media presence</a>, I know the achy, worn out feeling that can come from living and working in the digital world.Whether it's running a race physically or the digital race we each run daily, living and breathing in an online world can leave anyone feeling tired, weary and completely burnt-out.</p><h1 id=\"\"> 7 Ways to Transform Your Life and Business</h1><h2 id=\"\">  1. See it, feel it, believe in it</h2><p>Until you are ready and willing to make a change, the possibility of it will elude you. As the saying goes..”when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.” The same is true with change.When we're ready to willingly embrace the unknown, <strong id=\"\">change will magically begin to happen</strong>. Until then, the subconscious will hang onto past mistakes, bad habits and self-defeating beliefs.Letting go of those and embracing change is not easy and in fact, can be quite painful. However, the end result and the feeling of freedom that follows is more than worth the journey.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong> 2. Embrace it</h2><p>Simply being aware of change is not enough. You must <strong id=\"\">embrace the opportunity and encourage the possibility</strong> within your life and your business.Have you ever felt like you were standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to make a leap but something was holding you back? That something is the fear of what lies on the other side of that decision.What possibility is passing you by right this moment because you are afraid to make the leap?</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">  </strong>3. Romance it</h2><p>Take that change out on a date and live with it for a bit. Is it the change you were seeking or maybe just a pit stop on your way to the ultimate opportunity?Whether it is your final destination or just a much needed night out on the town; <strong id=\"\">your change will happen when and if you are ready to accept it</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Understand it</h2><p>Understanding how change affects you and how you in turn respond is important insight. Look back on previous change within your life; how did you react? Did you seize the opportunity and embrace it with open arms or did you fight it and push back with all of your might?Maria Robinson once said,</p><blockquote id=\"\">“<em id=\"\">Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending</em>.”</blockquote><p>What change can you embark upon that will breathe life into your new ending?</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong> 5. Accept it</h2><p>Once you understand, embrace and believe in change, the next step is acceptance.Acceptance is that moment when you realize <strong id=\"\">change is an inevitable part of your life</strong>. It is a moment when you see the beauty in change, acknowledging  how it allows you to  grow beyond any preconceived limitations.Whether change in your life or business has been wanted, created or envisioned up until this point, <strong id=\"\">acceptance gives you the fearless strength to take the reigns of your life and create the destiny you were born to live</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong> 6. Don’t Get Derailed</h2><p>Change is never easy and you will find yourself feeling frustrated and defeated along the way. <strong id=\"\">Don’t give up!</strong> Track your progress through a journal, calendar, business partner or mentor.However you prefer to keep track of all that’s transpiring in your life, make sure you reflect on your accomplishments. It can make a world of difference on those days you want to throw in the towel.</p><h2 id=\"\">  7. Celebrate Your Success!</h2><p>The <strong id=\"\">road to change</strong> is littered with broken promises, unfulfilled goals and feelings of doubt and self-worth. Don’t become a tragedy along that path. Strive to <strong id=\"\">make your change one that sticks</strong> by celebrating your success along the way.A celebration can be as simple as a scoop of your favorite ice cream or as fun as a new pair of shoes. The most important part of this is that you don’t deny yourself the simple pleasure of patting yourself on the back and saying “job well done!”<em id=\"\">So how about you. What is the greatest experience you've had because of a change you were willing to make? </em></p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>The end of the year is always an exciting time to evaluate and assess what marketing strategies worked in 2011 and which ones fizzled.  As we head into 2012, we should be focused on <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/social-media-content-strategy-cheat-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">creating a marketing plan</a> that is focused, targeted and strategic.There is much success for those who take the time to plan and create a detailed strategy.   While we will continue to see a purging from our industry, the opportunity available to those left standing will be immense.The question is how to run a leaner business with the same efficiency and skill we have in the past.  With that in mind, I’ve compiled the Top 5 Marketing Strategies for a Stellar 2012 designed to give you a creative boost and get your thought process rolling!</p><h1 id=\"\">5 Essential Marketing Strategies for a Stellar 2012</h1><h2 id=\"\">1.  Don’t Go It Alone</h2><p>No one succeeds by going it alone. We all need to surround ourselves with those people that support and promote our well-being as well as success.  Reach out to persons around you that have your best interests at heart.Ask for their advice and draw on them to solve your most pressing issues.Likewise, hire professionals to delegate tasks that do not require your day-to-day attention.  The question to ask yourself in 2012 is where your time will be best spent?  Stay focused on those tasks and ONLY those tasks.  The rest can and should be given away.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. Measure Your Results</h2><p>There is no marketing endeavor worth embarking on that should escape being measured.  There are tools galore when it comes to analyzing and tracking your goals and results.  Too often I see real estate agents beating the same old marketing drum year after year without any knowledge of whether the initial go-round was even successful.  Take the time to evaluate your progress and make appropriate changes to your strategy.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. Keep Pushing Forward</h2><p>As you see your friends and colleagues leave the business do not get the impression that you can slow down or take a break in your marketing efforts.  Keep pushing forward with your plans and make sure that you are constantly investing back into your business.  Just because the pack is thinning does not mean you can shirk your marketing responsibilities.Get the word out in new and innovative ways to your target market and keep it fresh, fun and engaging!</p><h2 id=\"\">4.  Do Your Homework</h2><p>When times are good, a lot of money is thrown at marketing strategies in the hope that something will stick.  Our fast and loose ways with those marketing dollars must be curtailed in a down market.  Whether you are researching a new system, tool or marketing campaign - Do Your Homework!Test your theories and discuss your strategies.  A lot has changed in the last several years; especially over the last 12 months.  What might have worked in the past is no longer viable.  Research and be objective in your decision.</p><h2 id=\"\">5.  Stay Focused on Your Goals</h2><p>In order to generate results, you must stay committed to your plan and overall goals.  Take your time to map out your strategy and determine what your key objectives are.  Then ask yourself a few important questions:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What steps will you take to reach those goals?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your timeline?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What tools will you use to create results?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What are your expectations?</li></ul><p>Stay hungry, and best of luck in 2012!</p>",

Whether it’s Facebook, Google or the latest tweet, answers to our most pressing questions have never been more readily available.The Internet has become the go-to resource for content, but wading through the social muck can be a challenge, and understanding where to begin when creating a <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/6-time-saving-strategies-for-social-media-success/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">social media</strong></a><strong id=\"\"> presence</strong> can feel overwhelming.As a business professional, being online and building your personal brand through social media is essential. However, simply showing up online is not enough.  Your <strong id=\"\">social media efforts</strong> require that you not only engage an already over stimulated society, but also increase your bottom line by providing fresh, relevant content.Building a social media content strategy and then creating a content calendar is an excellent way to keep you focused on the needs of your subscribers, fans and followers, rather than bouncing day to day without direction.</p><h1 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">24 Ideas to Rock Your Social Media Content Strategy</strong></h1><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Multi Media</strong></h2><p>1. What niche or program can you spotlight?  Whether it is you on screen or a screencast of your latest PowerPoint, connecting with your audience through video is imperative.  A free program to create and share your screencast is <a href=\"http://www.screenr.com/\" id=\"\">Screenr</a>.  Just click “record now” and within seconds you are recording anything you can see on your screen.  Then choose where you want to share your video instantly. Choose from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and more!2. Record an interview with a vendor or local business partner that can speak to your readers concerns and offer tips and quick fixes.  The amount of 60-90 second snippets you could create is endless!3. Create a video where you answer your potential clients frequently asked questions.4. Discuss current events and explain how it impacts your client.5. Choose locations in your area and pass along fun facts and trivia.  Pick a location and record a “Where’s Waldo” video with one simple question: where are you located.  Make sure your location is easy to identify.  Post this on Facebook and use it as a conversation starter or incorporate it into a giveaway.6. Record testimonials from your clients and post them to your blog and Facebook page as a way to boost credibility.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Step-by-Step Guides:</strong></h2><p>1. Walk your clients through the buying process. Turn your article into a pdf and then offer that download as an opt-in incentive on your website.2. Take frequently asked questions and offer an instructional guide3. Turn your product into a step-by-step instructional.  Not only do you allow clients to connect with you online and get a sense of who you are, but video is a great way to allow your potential clients to connect with you in a very authentic way.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How-to’s and Tip’s</strong></h2><p>1. Offer insight into the buying process and your expertise on what they can expect to gain by working with you or purchasing your product.   What common issues do your buyers  face?  What problems/challenges can you offer tips or how-to's on?2. Offer Weekly Tips or Tricks via video postcards.  A free online tool I have used many times is <a href=\"http://www.movavi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Movav</a>i.  It's easy to use and the price is right!3. Share slides from a recent presentation on <a href=\"http\" id=\"\">slideshare</a> and then copy and paste into a blog post.4. Share thoughts, takeaways and your most important clips from conferences, seminars, educational trainings etc. through slideshows, screencasts and slideshare.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Blog &amp; Social Media Content</strong></h2><p>1. Discuss highlights and share insights from recent industry events you have attended.  It's a great opportunity to give clients a behind the scenes look at your business and industry as you offer your feedback on what you learned or felt were the key takeaways.2. Promote your videos by syndicating to 25 video sites at once through <a href=\"http://www.tubemogul.com\" id=\"\">TubeMogul</a> and then track your results through their detailed analytics dashboard.3. Create weekly webinars related to questions on your blog or Facebook page.4. Revive past content by reposting videos, articles and trainings to Facebook, Twitter and Social Bookmarking sites.  If you are a Wordpress user, a great way to revive old blog posts is through Tweet Old Post.5. Ask via your social networks what the needs of your audience are and do this consistently.  It’s an easy way to stay topical and on target with the information your fans and followers are hungry for.  Then take this information and write a blog Q&amp;A that responds to their questions or concerns.6. Explain what a current event or topic means to your audience by either offering a unique perspective. You can also give details behind the who, what, why and how of a specific topic including the impact it will or could have on the industry.7. Take common myths and offer facts surrounding those often misunderstood topics.8. Promote company news including changes, events, updates, promotions, new hires, etc to allow the community to feel connected to the brand9. Survey your community through Survey Monkey or a Twtpoll about their most pressing questions and then use this material through an informational video or blog post.  Share information in a way that solves a challenge, fulfills a need or offers support.10. Share pictures as often as possible.  If there is an event or conference you attend, post the pictures to your social sites and write an article about it.  You want your audience to become interested and engaged in who you are and what matters most to you.11. Ask hypothetical questions or tell a story to identify clients needs.One last thought I will offer is the importance of tracking your efforts and consistently evaluating the effectiveness of your message through <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/social-media-analytics-4-tools-you-may-have-been-missing-87345\" id=\"\">social monitoring tools</a> such as SocialBro, Hootsuite, Twitter Counter and Crowd Booster.What social media tools or strategies would you add to this list?

Sharing what transpires in my day-to-day life has never been something that comes easy to me.  It could be that I grew up with a father who was always in the spotlight and knew that my lifestyle as well as any verbal vomit would severely impact his career.  Or maybe it was the lifestyle I chose with a very consumer-facing career in radio.  Both created an internal monitoring system that screamed, “Don’t do it” long before the words escaped my lips. </p><p>As you can imagine, I’m not one for small talk and certainly won’t be found in the corner of a party gossiping about my life or anyone else’s for that matter.  My tendency is to listen long before I speak or react no matter what the situation. Given that my  <a href=\"http://www.tonyrobbins.com/ue/disc-profile.php\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">DISC profile</strong></a> is an off the charts D and I, I can be somewhat of an enigma. My D has been the driving force behind each success within my life.  It allows me to step out in faith, but also gives me a strong sense of how I will achieve those goals. For as much as I succeed, I've failed time and again.  It’s those failures and my willingness to drag myself back into the race that make me who I am.  A fighter, a survivor, a champion.  Now my ‘I’ is another story.  I believe it has been completely manufactured by years of entertaining.  It emerged through hours of presenting, teaching, training and just plain BS’ing as we so often do in sales.  But it has served me well and will continue to be the glue that makes my relationships stick. <strong id=\"\">The Social Media Explosion</strong> Over the last several years as <strong id=\"\">social media</strong> emerged as a viable marketing resource, my challenge to communicate on a very real level was put to the test. I struggled to find meaning in the trivial details that were posted by friends and colleagues.  If you know me, you know that I’m more a meat and potatoes kind of gal.  I want to know the <em id=\"\">why and the how</em> before I can get to the <em id=\"\">what</em>.  <strong id=\"\">Social media</strong> flips that on its head.  Social media demands that we entice through the<em id=\"\"> ‘what’</em> and then engage and grow through the how-to.  As an educator and trainer this concept spoke to my heart and soul, but definitely not to my head.  At least initially. It wasn't until I began to blog that all of the dots started to connect.  Blogging was and is my outlet.  It allowed me to climb outside that internal monitor that kept most ‘feelings’ or “warm fuzzy’ posts as I like to call them locked deep inside.  I realized how freeing blogging and social media could be.  I also realized the ability we have to share and connect with like-minded individuals when we are willing to wear our emotions (somewhat) on our sleeves.  I will continue to fight that imaginary line I have created, but my ability to leap over it has become easier and easier.  <strong id=\"\">Work It, Tweak It, Find Your VoiceFinding my voice</strong> has been life changing, but it certainly wasn't found overnight.  I have worked at it, tweaked it, played around with it and tracked it incessantly. The perfectionist in me refuses to be bested by anything and social media is not any different then the next challenge which I'm delighted to say is one that I never expected.   I find myself stepping away from a 15 year career in mortgage and into a position where I manage the social media, blog content and online presence for a company that aligns perfectly with all that I have worked on and at for the last several years.  I will be working directly with real estate agents to grow their business all while growing the online presence for Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate.  It’s an exciting adventure and one that I’m ready to embrace mind, body and soul.  <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/life-is-a-journey-not-a-destination/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Life truly is a journey</strong></a> and one that if we reflect upon will present us with the <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/make-the-pieces-of-your-puzzle-fall-into-place/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">pieces to our perfect puzzle</strong></a><strong id=\"\">.  </strong>It is amazing to see how everything works together and that where we have been or even may be isn't our final destination.  Every day we have the ability to reshape and form the magical life we deserve to live.   Take at a look at your journey…what bread crumbs have you left behind?  What about them is speaking to you?  It is your destiny and your life; don’t let another day slip by without determining what path you should be walking and what tools you need to succeed.</p>",

Setting expectations up front will reduce stress and enable all parties to work together rather than fighting the process every step of the way.</p><h2 id=\"\">What Sets You Apart</h2><p>Your clients are dying to know who you are and what makes you tick.

Take one misstep and they will sense it immediately.  Do not withhold important details and make sure the bad news is given immediately.Set the ground rules by clearly setting the expectations and then communicate regularly as their transaction progresses.</p><h2 id=\"\">Are You Reliable</h2><p>And last but not least, our clients want to know if they can rely on us when push comes to shove.  Will you look out for their best interests and protect them in situations that fall inside your area of expertise?Give them your sage advice at the exact moment they need it.

      "wp-content": "<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson once commented that life wasn’t simply a destination, but rather a journey.  I would wholeheartedly agree.  I have witnessed the beautiful journey of discovery, exploration and destiny that we each have the opportunity to harness within our own lives.Unfortunately, as a society that spends an inordinate amount of time racing towards that next big milestone, slowing down to savor the journey is easier said than done.  Stopping to smell the proverbial roses defies the very “enough is never good enough” fiber that’s been woven into our psyche.  It’s that voice inside our head claiming that just one more “thing” (fill in the blank whether it’s tangible or abstract) will put us one step closer to true contentment.But when does that one more thing bringing the promise of eternal prosperity and peace actually arrive?  My fear is that with the light speed at which we live our lives; if and when it does land at our doorstep, we won’t be awake to recognize it.</p><h2 id=\"\"> At What Price Are We Running (from) Our Lives</h2><p>I have lived that life as long as I can remember.  I’ve worked 80 hour weeks, juggled multiple projects and burned the midnight oil until the wheels of creativity ground to a halt.  The problem I’ve only recently recognized was the destination I thought I was running towards was in actuality a life I was running away from.  Not on purpose mind you, but with the misguided belief that “contentment” equaled complacency and that would never amount to happiness.I reflect now on the little league games, school plays and anniversaries that I only enjoyed from the sidelines.  I was a stranger in my own life and true contentment was not a part of the equation.  Until I made a conscious choice to slow down and enjoy the journey.</p><h2 id=\"\">Let Your Journey Begin Today</h2><p>Life has so much to offer when we decide to stop chasing a destination and start soaking in all that the journey offers.Now I know I’ve lost many of you “Type A” or High D personalities.  You are so caught up in your self-important (gasp) world that missing out on moments that matter is only a fleeting after thought.  You are so trapped by the day-to-day of running your business that you have forgotten why you got married, had a child, bought a house, started your business and embarked on this life journey in the first place.  Believe me, I’ve been there and I can tell you unequivocally - WAKE UP now or regret it later.</p><h2 id=\"\">A Life Controlled by Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda isn’t Worth Living</h2><p>If the picture I’ve painted hits home, the life lessons (replete with my own unique wisdom) is this:</p><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">The little things in our lives do matter so do them - Every Single Day.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Loving what you do EVERYDAY is more important than enjoying what you do somedays so don’t wait one more day to stop just getting by.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Wasting your life on a destination and not enjoying the moments that make up your journey equal years of your life wasted.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Don’t wake up 10 years from now wanting what you had then.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Wishing and hoping do not mean your dreams will come true.  Put up or shut up and start living your life.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Working until you bleed company colors will not make you happy, satisfied or rich.  Love, family and the joy that accompany a full life is what make your world go round.</li></ol><p>And finally...Tomorrow means that today is your yesterday.  It’s your life; how will YOU choose to live it?</p>",

It is the foundation for a successful closing, a successful relationship and a storybook ending to a buyers dream home purchase.  In a world of delays, changes and inconsistency - Communication is KING!Horror stories of last minute delays within the mortgage process are not a new occurrence.  They do however seem to happen with far more frequency than in days past.  Whether it’s the request for additional documentation on the day of closing or the appraisal requiring repairs, delays seem inevitable.  Much of this is due to the constant state of upheaval the mortgage industry has and continues to be in.  As we all work to adjust our sails in an ever changing environment, the communication challenges created are unlike anything we’ve seen before.Over the many years of my career, the largest culprit of delays has come from a lack of communication.  Many listing agents have voiced concerns that Loan Officers refuse to convey details of the transaction until there is an urgent need.  I on the other hand would rather stay on the offensive then the defensive.  In my opinion, communication is KING when it comes to a successful transaction!A system I have created over my fifteen years in the mortgage industry is my initial introduction phone call to the listing agent. It is a terrific opportunity to offer insight into who I am, who my team and company are and how the two of us can effectively work together.It is during this conversation that I ask many important questions that will allow us to uncover any potential issues before they become “show stoppers.”</p><h2 id=\"\">Listing Agent Introduction Phone Call</h2><ol id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Will the seller attend closing?  It’s important to understand whether or not this transaction will be a mail out to the seller.  There are typically 3-5 additional days needed to accomplish this.  Lenders will need to provide final figures and documents to the title company several days early in order to meet the closing date.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Will the seller be signing or will there be a Power of Attorney used?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Where will the closing be held?  Title company, listing agents office, etc.</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is your preferred method of communication?   Email, phone, or text.  I have seen a 100% increase in texting over the last 2 years.  I often wonder when this became an acceptable form of communication within a business transaction, but I meet them where they’re most comfortable.  That is until there is a difficult conversation that needs to be had or a resolution found.  At that point, you no longer get to hide behind your phone.  You must actually pick it up and speak with the person on the other end!</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do you work with or on a team?  Is there a main point of contact and if so, would you like to be included in any of our conversations?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is this a short sale, bank owned or HUD property?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do we have short sale approval?</li> \t<li id=\"\">How many business days in advance of closing does the bank/seller require to review figures?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is this a townhouse or condo?

      "wp-content": "<p>With four new iPhone 4s’ in my house, the last several days have been a non stop iPhone learning extravaganza.  As a recent Apple convert I have found an abundance of websites offering iPhone tips for newbies on everything from productivity tools to time sucking games ala <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8\" id=\"\">Angry Birds</a>.  The challenge for me has been taking in the \"shininess\" of my new toy and getting anything else accomplished!While the cool tools on the iPhone 4s continue to amaze me, Siri has definitely emerged as one of the best additions made by Apple.  In case you’re not familiar with Siri, this is Apple’s new voice control assistant that allows you to send messages, call friends, create reminders and schedule appointments all through voice command.While these tips may be a bit basic for former iPhone users, I hope newbies like myself will enjoy making the most of their new smart phone!</p><h4 id=\"\">Multitask</h4><p>True multitasking arrived with iOS 4, but it still seems a mystery to most iPhone users I’ve talked to.  Multitasking with the iPhone 4s is very simple and allows you to open multiple apps at once.Double click your Home button to view your open apps.  As your screen rolls up, the icons remaining in your task tray are open and running on your iPhone.  Slide through each and choose the apps you want to open.This means you are able to stream music from websites such as Pandora and control it in your task bar while navigating to other apps.**Additional Tip:  To close an open app, choose an app from your task tray and click and hold the app until they begin to jiggle.  You will now see a small minus sign in the upper left hand corner of the app.  Tap the sign to close out the app.  Click the Home button once to exit.</p><h4 id=\"\">Quickly Take a Screenshot of Your Phone</h4><p>Need to take a screenshot of the page you are currently viewing? It’s easy!  Quickly press and then release your home and sleep button simultaneously to snap a picture of your screen.  The image will not pop up but is now saved in your camera roll under Photos.  Once you’ve snapped the shot you can share it via email, use it as your wallpaper, tweet it out or save it for future reference.  If you work within a team like I do, this will be an invaluable tool to quickly send information without the time it might take to scan a pdf or document.And while we're talking about photos, another exciting change is that you can now take a picture from your lock screen.  Access your camera without entering your pass code or navigating to your camera.</p><h4 id=\"\">Clean Up Your Apps &amp; Create Folders</h4><p>For those of us on “app overload” creating folders is a huge help! Rather than scrolling through pages and pages of apps, you can drag and drop apps onto each other to create organized folders.To do this tap and hold the app and then drag it on top of another app. When you release the app a screen will pop up asking what you would like to name your folder.  You  can then continue to drag and drop similar apps into that folder making for a much cleaner screen to work within.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428220d07c9bb2c9f96d14b_Create-iPhone-4s-Folder.jpeg\" alt=\"Create iPhone 4s Folder\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h4 id=\"\">Set Up Your Relationships with SIRI</h4><p>This was a fun little trick I discovered over the weekend.  Once you have imported your contacts you can identify your husband/wife, mom, dad, sister, brother and then quickly call or text each of them by asking Siri to contact them.  For example...I ask Siri to call my husband.  Siri tells me she is dialing Dean Radice.  It’s that simple and a great way to stay hands free while driving those buyers around in your car!Setting up your relationships is as easy as 1,2,3 with SIRI!</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Hold down your Home button to activate Siri</li> \t<li id=\"\">Tell Siri your relationship to your contact.  For example: “Dean is my husband” (you can also have a lot of fun in how you define or name your relationships...e.g \"sugar daddy\" as opposed to husband or \"blank check\" for my college son.  You get the idea.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Siri will automatically connect the relationship with that contact</li></ul><h4 id=\"\">Tap to get to the Top</h4><p>Do you find yourself scrolling through websites only to find now easy way to navigate back towards the top?  The good news is that no matter what website you have found yourself trapped in, tapping the status bar at the top of your screen will automatically bring you to the top of the page.Depending on how much time you plan on spending online, this is invaluable!And a last one just for fun...Ask Siri a QuestionMy last tip is purely for entertainment value.  Boys will be boys and mine have certainly spent their time researching fun questions to ask Siri.  Here are just a few for you to try out:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Who’s on first?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Will you marry me?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What do you think of Microsoft?</li></ul><p>For more fun with Siri, check out <a href=\"http://thingsthatsirisays.com/\" id=\"\">http://thingsthatsirisays.com/</a></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428220d07c9bb29e996d14c_Things-That-Siri-Says.jpeg\" alt=\"Things That Siri Says\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure>",

Attract attention through your Tweets by offering a free report.  If you use Wordpress and work with a system like AWeber it is as easy as creating your web form and grabbing the html code.  Once you have done that, you can add it to your Wordpress site through the text widget.What strategies are you using to <strong id=\"\">build your Twitter following</strong>?

      "wp-content": "<p>On most days, I consider myself a pretty joyful gal.  There isn’t much that throws me for a loop or takes my attitude sideways.  After 16 years in sales, I’ve come to realize that on any given day we all have “stuff” going on behind the scenes that impacts our ability to think clearly.  It also affects our attitude towards others.My commitment to self-preservation and sanity was to make a conscious choice about my mood many years ago.  I would rather own my state of mind than allow someone else’s nasty disposition to own me.   It was only after some hefty emotional roller coasters that I decided to forge my own mental path and commit to a cheery disposition no matter how your day is treating you.That being said,  there are  days that feel as if someone has deliberately attempted to suck the joy out of my life.I was standing in line at Starbucks yesterday and was not surprised to find the line weaving across the crowded coffee shop like a snake stretched towards the sun.  As I worked my way through packed tables towards the end of the line I decided to seize this “delay” and play a little catch up on email.I had been perusing through the hundreds of emails piled up over a 2 hour span when I heard an argument in front of me begin to heat up.  Two ladies who had made their way to the front of the line were now arguing with both each other and the barista.As I attempted to listen in I realized the gist of the argument was this:  “Tanya” was running late to meet her friend “Lisa” and being that their relationship had spanned over two decades, Lisa took it upon herself to order for both of them.  Tanya, one of those “high maintenance” coffee drinkers was prone to standing at the counter for several minutes deliberating over the precise ingredients for today’s coffee choice.  Lisa felt she knew her friends trouble over making a decision inside and out and was comfortable in ordering for her.  She was wrong.Lisa had made a vital mistake in ordering Tanya’s “go to” hazelnut rather than the “oh so fallish” offering of a pumpkin latte.  This had spiraled into a “how do you not know me” and “I thought you were my best friend” war of words between Tanya and Lisa.  It also brought a barrage of accusations that were thrown at the barista for not fixing Tanya’s order fast enough.  All three were now so worked up that all attention had been turned towards them.It was at this exact moment I thought…”Whoa!”  How many times in my life have I allowed a haphazard moment to steal my joy and suck the life out of my seemingly happy day?  Wouldn’t I be far more productive if I could shrug those moments off and triumph over that current frustration?   If I could identify those moments and what my “triggers” are; how much easier would it be to gauge my reaction?Determine what those moments that set your blood boiling and cause steam to shoot straight out of your ears.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">A car cuts you off in traffic</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your computer is running slow and forces you to reboot right in the middle of an important project</li> \t<li id=\"\">Someone ate your lunch (with your name on it I might add) in the break room</li> \t<li id=\"\">A client you drove around all day Saturday now refuses to call you back</li> \t<li id=\"\">A guy in what was the shortest drive through bank line now appears to actually be taking out a home loan causing you to run behind on your next appointment.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Your mother just called for the third time today to tell you your “perfect” sister is coming into town and you now have the job of chauffeuring her around for the next 3 days</li> \t<li id=\"\">It’s 9pm and your 8 year old daughter just told you that tomorrow is her day to bring snacks for the entire class</li></ul><p>I am convinced that life brings us these moments to challenge and entice us.

Build Your List</h2><p>Building an email or subscriber list should be a key objective in your social media marketing goals for 2014. It allows you to stay top-of-mind and expands your reach as those loyal to your brand are likely to share your email.Use your social networks to promote an incentive, giveaway, or contest. A free Ebook with valuable tips you have collected over the years with your target market is a great way to get people to opt in while positioning you as an expert within your field.Let's face it. We all love free stuff, especially eBooks that are easy to download and digest. Just remember, your book does not need to be lengthy, just relevant and content-rich.Try a free service like <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/features/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Mailchimp</a> to create lists, and build newsletters and powerful email announcements that can be tracked and followed within their analytics dashboard.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/639f259a8defc0979cded246/6428220baa346294635258de_mailchimp.jpeg\" alt=\"mailchimp\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">  2. Position Your Brand</h2><p>Getting social and building your personal brand will begin to establish you as the local expert and a trustworthy resource as consumers increasingly look to the Internet for advice.With a social media referral often taking precedence over any other type of referral, it is imperative that your business be visible, accessible, and readily available.</p><h4 id=\"\">Herbert Simon, an American economist said that “with every abundance comes a new scarcity.”</h4><p>With the abundance of social media channels comes the challenge for marketers to <strong id=\"\">cut through the chatter</strong> and get their voices heard.The overwhelming number of choices consumers have with the click of a button or a simple search can make this a daunting task but one well worth your time and effort. Images are a perfect way to build brand authority and streamline your look and feel.Use a tool like <a href=\"http://picmonkey.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">PicMonke</a>y to turn a stock image into a branded graphic.

Once you know the answer to who your clients are and where they are spending their time, you must identify their needs, wants, and desires.Determining this is your first step to maintaining focus and keeping your message targeted and effective.Fight the feeling that you must be everything to everyone when you first begin.

Be Picky When Choosing Your Social Sites</h2><p>While it is tempting to every social networking site, realize that you do not need to be on every one initially.Take social media in small, bite-sized chunks and determine where you can get the most exposure based on where your potential customers spend their time.

Establishing relationships that transition casual readers into loyal blog fans will not happen overnight.While maintaining a consistent flow of <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/how-to-increase-blog-traffic-with-engaging-content/\" id=\"\">engaging content</a> is vital, there are other key aspects that build credibility, trust and loyalty between you and your readers.Newbie bloggers can find it frustrating to pour both heart and soul into a post only to receive zero feedback. But don’t be discouraged. There are sure-fire ways to take your blog from top-secret to daily destination.</p><h2 id=\"\">  1. Post Consistently</h2><p>Posting consistently lends credibility to your blog.  However, finding inspiration on a daily basis can be a challenge. In order to stick with your posting schedule, take the time to put a system in a place.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Create a monthly schedule or blog calendar and decide how many posts per week you can commit to.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Pick the day(s) and time you will post so your readers become accustom to looking for you.</li> \t<li id=\"\">Use a content or editorial calendar to plan your strategy in advance. Choose your topics based on the needs of your audience and be willing to adjust if needed. There are multiple ways to create your calendar including Excel, Google Docs or Google Calendar.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">  2.  Be an Active Part of Your Community</h2><p>Many elements affect how your readers view and interact with your blog. If you have a habit of posting and disappearing, your readers will take notice. Become an active part of your blog community and respond promptly to any and all comments.Treat your readers with the same respect you would any client. They are the lifeblood of your online world. A loyal community will evolve if you consistently interact, engage and reply in a timely manner and with an authentic voice.</p><h2 id=\"\">  3. Be a Valuable Resource</h2><p>Answer questions, provide tips and offer items of value that are relevant to your readership.  Listen to your readers and find ways to solve their problems. Doing this will establish you as the go-to authority within your field or market.Remember, this is a commitment to your community. Giving freely of your insight, wisdom and knowledge will allow readers to see that you are building a relationship and not simply chasing a paycheck.</p><h2 id=\"\">  4. Content Counts</h2><p>There is no getting around it: You can't just throw a post up on your blog and expect it to resonate with your readers. You need quality, targeted content.  Without it, even the best of techniques will fail to result in new subscribers.If you have an existing blog, your answer to what content is relevant to your readers can be found in your analytics. Scroll through your posts and see which topics generated the most comments.  Are these topics in line with what you want to promote or are they tangents to your main direction that you can develop further?Ask questions, listen to the answers and study your analytics.  It is very easy to see through analytics where your readers came from, what keywords they used to end up on your page and how long they are staying on your site.  This is precisely why it is vital to speak directly to the needs of your readers and adjust that message to encourage readership growth.</p><h2 id=\"\">  5. Let Your Passion Shine Through</h2><p>If you love what you do then it should reflect in everything you say and write.  Be excited about what you have to offer and why your product or service will not only meet, but exceed their expectations.Consumer’s sense desperation so make sure to keep your posts upbeat, positive and informative without getting bogged down by dreary details.  This is a business, your business and not some idle chatter with friends. Take ownership of the information you post and the resources you provide.</p><h2 id=\"\">  6. Stop Sitting on the Sidelines</h2><p>The single most effective way to build loyalty and trust is through conversation.  A blog allows readers to get to know you on a very intimate level.  If you let comments sit without responding or even acknowledging them, you are giving away a valuable opportunity.  You not only have the chance to answer their question in a public forum, but you allow your readers to see that you care about their needs and are there to assist when they are ready.Building trust with your blog readers takes courage, confidence in your product or service and a willingness to \"go deep\" with the very people that can and will elevate your blog to new heights.

Have you</p><blockquote id=\"\">Being remarkable as defined by Webster is the ability to “Attract notice by being unusual, striking or extraordinary.”</blockquote><p>Being remarkable means going above the norm by doing, saying, offering, or being that individual who puts more heart, soul, and thought into your actions.Being remarkable takes a common occurrence and turns it into an exceptional moment of opportunity.Being remarkable also requires offering remarkable customer service. After all, remarkable service translates into remarkable results. So how do you define remarkable?Is it answering your phone before 8 am and after 5 pm, offering a sympathetic ear or giving a few extra minutes of advice to a potential client?Being remarkable happens in both the seemingly inconsequential moments as well as the monumental ones. No matter how you define it, finding your remark-ability is simply determining what being remarkable looks like in your business.</p><h1 id=\"\">How Do You Define Remarkable Social Media Results</h1><h2 id=\"\">Be Innovative</h2><p>You've seen it on social media time and time again. The same idea packaged up in a new way. Is it innovative? Hardly. Is it thought-provoking? Nope.Whether it's an idea, process, or strategy, swiping content isn't new. Yet, it Even though its shown up a million times and yet, here it is again. Stepping outside the common everyday online conversations can be inspiring. Instead of existing in a bubble, you open yourself up to new experiences.Now more than ever, people are hungry for groundbreaking; inventive ideas that tell them you offer more than the average salesperson.Maybe it’s a new system to track and capture buyer leads that give your seller hope that even in our current market, their home will sell. It could be a marketing plan that adds the WOW one-two punch to your listing presentation. Whatever the case, innovation is a welcome change in a world of imitation.</p><h2 id=\"\">Do the Unexpected</h2><p>Mediocrity up in two words: Average and Ordinary. Doing the unexpected can be the difference between mediocre results and spectacular, life altering accomplishments.Have your efforts become stale and is your energy waning? Re-energize by doing something unpredictable, spontaneous and fun within your business.Break out of the mold and the tried and true of the past. Break into the new and spectacular YOU!</p><h2 id=\"\">Cause a Stir</h2><p>Nothing creates a stir more than controversy.  If you feel stuck in the muck within your business, being a little divisive might be your answer.Not divisive for the sake of it, but because you are ready to take a stand for what you believe in.  What are you passionate about in your business?What makes the hair on your neck stand up and take notice? Being true to who you really are and how you actually feel about your business connects you to the right people.Read that again.Be true to YOU and find the right people that will make the right changes within your business.Do it today.</p>",

The richness of life lies in memories we have forgotten.”Life is all about moments.  Moments we choose and those moments that seemingly choose us.Whether it’s a first kiss, first car, first day in college or a moment that takes our breath away – life is all about surprise and wonder.  It’s the sensation of the moment that leaves us with memories we won’t soon forget and will always remember.Now is one of those moments in our industry.  It’s a time of scarcity, instability and fear.  It’s also a magical time of opportunity that will leave those of us with the ability to grab on to that moment feeling grateful for the abundance that we see on the other side.  It’s this moment that we must seize and make the most of.  It’s not a time to hide our heads in the sand or a time of fearful decision-making.  Leaders are born out of difficult times and from adversity will rise to levels never seen in their business before.When the dust settles on the Real Estate Industry, how will you say you chose to live in this moment?  Did you grab on to the opportunity swirling around you and forever change the trajectory of your business or will you look back longingly on moments gone by and memories of an ill-fated profession?</p><h1 id=\"\">Steps to Seizing Your Moment of Opportunity</h1><h2 id=\"\">Sometimes One Door Leads to Another</h2><p>Just because it doesn’t feel like the right opportunity, doesn’t make it a wrong decision right now.  Every door that opens is a possibility towards your end goal. The question to ask is whether this door will bring you one step closer to your desires.  Let me give you a real life example of what one door of opportunity brought to me.In 1996 I was working as co-host on the top rated morning show in my city.  Sounds glamorous right?  Wrong.  I was up at 4am, off work at 1pm and working many evenings in a local nightclub or bar doing what are known as“live remotes.”  I was a single mom barely making ends meet and exhausted 99% of my life.One day on a whim my boyfriend and I decided to try out a new local restaurant.  The food was fantastic and I raved about it on the air the next day.  The owner was told by an employee about my testimonial and called the station later that day to invite us back in.  We once again visited the restaurant and quickly became friends with this gentleman.When my boyfriend and I decided to get married and buy our first home together, the restaurant owner referred us to a local lender who frequented his restaurant as well.  These two ladies were phenomenal in assisting us and by closing I was asking what it would take to enter the world of mortgage lending.  I spent the next 6 months doing everything from processing assistant to marketing and was now ready to quit my day job and call it a full-time profession.After 1 year in the business, the two owners decided to retire and asked if my now husband and I would like to buy the business.  We bought it and flourished as a local mortgage broker for 10 years until we decided to move out of the broker business and into a mortgage banker role.Every one of these people has become a lifelong friend and mentor.  My point is this:Two of the biggest changes in my life up until that point – a new career and the chance to become a small business owner - would never have come about if I hadn’t seized an opportunity that came through a simple phone call.</p><h2 id=\"\">Be prepared</h2><p>Be ready, willing and able to seize an opportunity the moment it comes along.  Being prepared allows you to make a timely decision.  Having the ability and clarity in purpose to make that decision divides the winners from the losers. Choose your door, walk through it and resolve to make the most of it.</p><h2 id=\"\">Have the courage to make a change</h2><p>Just because you walked through one door of opportunity doesn’t mean you can’t walk through another and another and another.  Have the courage to change course if where you are  in your life is not where you want to be.You hold the keys (yes pun intended) to your destiny.  It’s often those moments when we step outside of our comfort zone that lead us to our greatest achievements.  Those moments of greatness just might let you to make a change that leaps you over and through the realm of possibility.</p><h2 id=\"\">Don’t be afraid to shut a door</h2><p>Not every door that opens is the right one.  I have an internal guidance system called my gut that I trust over just about anything else.  If it doesn’t feel right and you have discussed the pros and cons with mentors and all signs point to “no” – then go with your gut and shut that door.</p><h2 id=\"\">Sometimes the Right Door Needs a Good Kick</h2><p>Every once in a while you will come upon a door that just won’t budge. People that succeed will not just walk through an open door, but will break down barriers that stand in their way of opportunity.  Never fear a stubborn door, kicking it in might be the extra oomph you need to make a change.The world is full of people desperate to make a change, but so few do.  Break out of the woulda, coulda, shoulda’s and the crippling effects of moments lost.Seize your moment of opportunity by committing to making the most of each and every one that life has to offer you.</p>",

It brings with it the freedom to manage your message and offers the visibility many businesses fail to find with any other marketing medium.The design, content creation and promotion that transpires in order to produce and maintain a superstar blog is exhilarating. The benefits are improved brand awareness, increased reach and significant financial returns. But at the end of the day, no blog becomes a superstar overnight. Building a successful blog requires vision, an unfailing commitment to purpose and a willingness to go that extra mile.It can be easy to lose focus and find yourself sidetracked in the beginning. This makes it imperative that you understand a few key elements that make up a successful and eventually profitable blog.</p><h1 id=\"\">Know Your Audience</h1><p>When I first started blogging, I struggled to find my purpose.  I was a random blogger without consistency.  I also lacked content that served any one niche in particular.  I was spinning on the Ferris Wheel of trepidation and fear. I worried that if I took a stand, I would somehow miss the massive target audience I was seeking.My mistake was simple and one that many early bloggers make.  I did not identify who I was truly looking to reach. I had forgotten the importance of having an intimate understanding of my audience, an awareness of what motivates them and a deep desire to satisfy their needs.Ask yourself these questions to define your target audience:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">Who does your product or service serve?</li> \t<li id=\"\">What is their age, location, income level and marital status?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Why would they buy your product or service?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Where is your audience spending their time online?</li></ul><h1 id=\"\">Superstars Commit to Purpose</h1><p>Finding the meaning behind what you write may not be something you immediately identify with. This is why it is important to stick with topics you are familiar with. Take your knowledge, your years of expertise and your passion for your message and put your heart and soul in to each article. If you are longing for a purpose behind your blog, answer a few important questions.</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">What drives and excites you?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is your brand unique?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Is your message clear and powerful?</li> \t<li id=\"\">Do you have a system in place to effectively stay in front of prospects and past clients?</li></ul><p>A couple of these are soul searching, gut wrenching \"why the heck do I get out of bed\" questions. Take your time and answer them. Ignoring  your answers is a mistake and a regret you will have down the road.</p><h1 id=\"\">Superstars Are Passionate</h1><p>Are you passionate about your topics?  If you only blog for the search engines, you will quickly lose your enthusiasm for the subject matter. Blogging consistently requires you to be on fire for your topic. Consistency will build authority and credibility, but it will take time.Writing about your topics should come as natural as breathing. If your content feels forced, your readers will sense that.I encourage you to perform a small test. Write down the first 10 topics that come to your mind.  Then ask yourself if these topics excite you and whether or not they are something that you could write about daily. If your answer is yes and they are not a part of your blog now, then you need to consider making a change. If not, begin to eliminate the ones you dislike and focus on the top 3 - 5 that knock your socks off.</p><h1 id=\"\">Superstars Create a Conversation</h1><p>Do you work daily to engage your readers, draw on their emotions, and ask them to discuss, debate and contact you?  Are you asking open ended questions or using free offers or advice to draw them in?  Have you defined a call to action and do you ask them to take action on a consistent basis?If you do not create a conversation then you will never gain an audience that feels a part of your community.  Make it feel like home to them. A community where they belong and enjoy spending their time.  You also want to create a feeling of loss if they miss an article.Take a look at your current content and determine how you can drive readers to your blog and engage them consistently.  e.g. blogging about hot topics, local information, answering frequently asked questions.  Be specific and then take action by adding this to your blog.</p><h1 id=\"\">Superstars Relate to Their Audience</h1><p>By continuously offering value to your readers, you create a rhythm and a reason behind your blog. As your readers begin to comment, listen intently to their feedback. What worries or concerns them and where can you meet that need? Craft your content around their most pressing wants and desires.Remember: your articles should be a refuge, an answer to their problems and a reassuring voice throughout their purchase decision. Give them the information they are searching for in an easy to digest format and they will be forever grateful.You can turn your blog into the superstar catalyst that drives you toward your goals.  Identify your purpose and then write with conviction. Open up your creative flood gates and allow your audience to connect and grow your brand and your bottom line.</p>",

Now you are left with a few remaining hours to pack school lunches and prepare for a new week.  So where does the “me” in time come in?  Sadly, finding time for ourselves is not a luxury many of us have in our hectic lives. We run from one appointment to the next and then wonder where the day went.  As self-employed entrepreneurs, managing our time is essential to our success.  The good news is that you can simplify your week ten times over by just taking 30 minutes on a Sunday evening to prepare.<strong id=\"\">Write it Down</strong>Take 10 minutes on Sunday night to write down every objective you have for the week.  Do you have 5 clients you need to call?  Write them down and be specific.  A goal isn’t a goal in action until it is specific.  If you would rather put it into your Outlook or Google calendar then do it.  Just make sure it’s specific and actionable.  You also need a deadline.  When will you accomplish those calls by?<strong id=\"\">Plan Your Meals</strong>How many times have you hit 2pm only to realize by the groaning in your stomach that you haven’t eaten yet?  Planning your meals ahead of time gives you the ability to pack your lunch at the same time you are packing the kids.  It’s healthier than the food truck down the street and it eliminates the last minute stress of trying to find <em id=\"\">anything</em> appealing as you run out the door each morning.<strong id=\"\">Put on Your Happy Face</strong>Make a commitment to waking up Monday morning and embracing the day.  All too often our Monday’s are a sign of a long week ahead of us.  This frame of mind sets the tone for our week which in turn inflates or deflates our motivation.  Your motivation is in direct proportion to your results.  Want to see better results?  Turn that frown upside down and get HAPPY!  A happy person is a productive person!<strong id=\"\">STOP Saying You Will “Get to it Tomorrow”</strong>Procrastination is not only a momentum killer, it’s also a motivation zapper.  If you find yourself putting off certain to-do’s day after day, I challenge you to make that your first task of the day.  You will be amazed at the sense of freedom that it will give you.  Your brain (you know, the one working overtime to avoid that task) will breathe a sigh of relief and might even feel encouraged to get creative in your marketing or sales efforts.  Imagine the results if you just GET IT DONE?!<strong id=\"\">Quit Whining</strong>Life is too short to constantly complain about what we are juggling.  We all have multiple balls we juggle on a daily basis so get over it.  You aren’t special when it comes to multi-tasking.  It’s called life.  So STOP whining and get out there and live it!</p>",

      "wp-content": "<p>Guest blogging can be a powerful business building tool. Unfortunately, it is grossly underutilized and highly misunderstood by many aspiring bloggers.Building a credible blog that encourages active participation is one of the biggest hurdles all bloggers face . That is where guest blogging can help!</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Guest Blog</h2><p>When I first entertained writing guest posts, my questions were – why would I submit a guest post, how do I know where I want to guest post and most importantly - what’s in it for me?I needed to know why I would write anywhere other than my own blog and why I would pass along content that I had worked so hard to prepare?I had two main concerns:</p><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">That I would be pushing people towards a blog I didn’t own</li> \t<li id=\"\">Therefore I would have no control over that blog or my content</li></ul><p>Both were valid concerns, but missed the mark. Guest blogging is not about control, it is about the community, engagement and relationships that you build.</p><h2 id=\"\">Building Awareness through Quality Content</h2><p>Guest blogging gives you the chance to seek out well established authority blogs that can increase the awareness and visibility of your online presence.Chances are an authority blog that has been around for a good amount of time has an established and loyal readership. Your job as a guest blogger is to offer inspiring and enlightening content that connects with their subscribers.With quality content, guest blogging can enhance your credibility and drive readers to your own blog where they can find content similar to their interests. The goal is to acquire readership and traffic that might not have found you otherwise.</p><h3 id=\"\">Other benefits an authority blog can offer:</h3><ul id=\"\"> \t<li id=\"\">An increase in notoriety and an established or improved reputation within your given area of expertise</li> \t<li id=\"\">Buzz that goes viral when your post is tweeted and shared</li> \t<li id=\"\">Readers that are already interested in your niche</li> \t<li id=\"\">Improved search engine ranking</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Before You Start Guest Blogging</h2><p>The biggest mistake bloggers can make is requesting a guest blog spot before building a solid base of quality content. It is essential that you have at least a few articles on your own blog first before you try pushing people towards it.If you have a passion for your niche and are able to connect with your current reader base, more than likely that will translate to posts written on a blog with similar interests.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Get Started</h2><p>Your first step is determining what value you will bring as a guest blogger. Then do your homework. Who are the leading or authority blogs within your niche? Is their content in line with yours and do you enjoy reading the blog? It goes a long way with a blog owner if you have personal experience with the authors content and feel that it's beneficial enough to share with your own community.Your next step is to reach out to the blog owner. A simple email requesting a guest post is where you will begin. This is where you want to keep it short, sweet and to the point. There is no need to drag out your request with pages of links. Include a few relevant links to your previous articles along with an explanation as to why you feel their blog and your content are a perfect match. Make sure you express why you are interested and what you currently write about.Guest blogging can be your ticket to heightened online awareness, improved readership and increased blog traffic. Will you take advantage of this business booster?</p>",

You might save some time, but you sure won’t save your reputation.And the price you pay for not engaging with your audience is the ultimate one.You lose the respect and trust of the very people you were looking to connect with in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"\">Final Thoughts</h2><p>Social Media Marketing isn't about play time on Instagram or <a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/facebook-marketing-tips-that-will-increase-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Facebook</a>. It’s about getting social.Make the commitment today to engage with your audience, fans, readers and fellow bloggers.And for goodness sake, take them on a date, don't try to get married right out of the gate.They'll thank you for it and your success will be created because of it.</p>",
